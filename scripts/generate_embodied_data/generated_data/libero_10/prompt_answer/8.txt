### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm that needs to place two specific items, alphabet soup and tomato sauce, into a white wicker basket located on a table. The items are initially placed around the table, and the robot must navigate its arm to pick up each item and place it in the basket. The task is divided into several high-level movements, each of which is a sequence of primitive actions (e.g., moving up, moving right, stopping).

### High-Level Movements and Justifications

Based on the executed trajectory, the high-level movements and their justifications are as follows:

1. **Move Up (Steps 70-74)**
   - **Justification**: The robot needs to lift its arm to avoid any obstacles and position itself correctly to reach the first item (alphabet soup).
   
2. **Move Right (Steps 148-153)**
   - **Justification**: After lifting the arm, the robot needs to move horizontally to the right to align with the position of the first item (alphabet soup).

3. **Move Up (Steps 215-216)**
   - **Justification**: After picking up the first item, the robot needs to lift its arm again to avoid any obstacles and prepare to move towards the basket.

### Plan for Solution

The high-level plan for completing the task is as follows:
1. Move the arm up to avoid obstacles and position it over the first item (alphabet soup).
2. Move the arm right to align with the position of the first item.
3. Pick up the first item (alphabet soup).
4. Move the arm up to avoid obstacles and prepare to move towards the basket.
5. Move the arm to the basket and place the first item in it.
6. Repeat the process for the second item (tomato sauce).
