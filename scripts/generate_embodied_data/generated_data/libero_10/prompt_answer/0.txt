### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a white mug from the left plate and place it on the right plate, and then pick up a yellow and white mug from the right plate and place it on the left plate. The environment consists of a silver robotic arm, a white mug on the left plate, and a yellow and white mug on the right plate. The goal is to execute this task efficiently while avoiding any obstacles and ensuring the mugs are placed correctly.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features`, the high-level movements that were most likely executed are:
1. **Move to the left plate to pick up the white mug** (Steps 0-30)
2. **Move to the right plate to place the white mug** (Steps 31-60)
3. **Move to the right plate to pick up the yellow and white mug** (Steps 61-90)
4. **Move to the left plate to place the yellow and white mug** (Steps 91-123)

#### Plan for the Solution
The plan for completing the task is as follows:
1. Move the robotic arm to the left plate.
2. Pick up the white mug from the left plate.
3. Move the robotic arm to the right plate.
4. Place the white mug on the right plate.
5. Move the robotic arm back to the right plate.
6. Pick up the yellow and white mug from the right plate.
7. Move the robotic arm to the left plate.
8. Place the yellow and white mug on the left plate.
