### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl from the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and place it on a plate. The environment contains various objects, including a silver metal bowl, a red and white plate, a box of snacks, a white plate, a small silver bowl, and a black bowl. The wooden cabinet has multiple drawers, and the black bowl is located in the top drawer. The plate where the black bowl needs to be placed is also present in the environment.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Move towards the wooden cabinet** (Steps 7-18)
   - The robot needs to move forward to reach the wooden cabinet.
2. **Move up to align with the top drawer** (Steps 74-78)
   - Once near the cabinet, the robot needs to move up to align with the top drawer.
3. **Move left to position the arm over the top drawer** (Steps 89-100)
   - After aligning with the top drawer, the robot needs to move left to position the arm over the drawer.
4. **Move down to open the top drawer and pick up the black bowl** (Steps 103-119)
   - The robot then moves down to open the top drawer and pick up the black bowl.
5. **Move back to the plate** (Steps 120-139)
   - Finally, the robot moves back to the plate to place the black bowl.

### Plan for the Solution
- **Move towards the wooden cabinet**: The robot needs to move forward to reach the cabinet.
- **Align with the top drawer**: Once near the cabinet, the robot needs to move up to align with the top drawer.
- **Position the arm over the top drawer**: After aligning with the top drawer, the robot needs to move left to position the arm over the drawer.
- **Open the top drawer and pick up the black bowl**: The robot then moves down to open the drawer and pick up the black bowl.
- **Move back to the plate**: Finally, the robot moves back to the plate to place the black bowl.
