### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl from a cookie box and place it on a plate. The environment consists of a table where both the cookie box and the plate are located. The black bowl is initially on top of the cookie box. The goal is to navigate the robotic arm to the bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the plate and release it.

### High-Level Movements and Justification

Based on the executed trajectory and the task, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals and justifications:

1. **Move to the Bowl** (Steps 5-25)
   - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to position itself directly above the black bowl to prepare for grasping. This involves moving forward until the arm is directly above the bowl.
   
2. **Lower Arm to Grasp the Bowl** (Steps 26-32)
   - **Justification**: Once the arm is positioned above the bowl, it needs to lower itself to grasp the bowl. This involves moving downward until the gripper is at the appropriate height to pick up the bowl.
   
3. **Lift the Bowl** (Steps 56-56)
   - **Justification**: After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to lift it off the cookie box. This involves moving upward to clear the box and any potential obstacles.
   
4. **Move to the Plate** (Steps 64-68)
   - **Justification**: With the bowl lifted, the arm needs to navigate to the plate. This involves moving left to align with the plate's position.
   
5. **Lower Arm to Place the Bowl** (Steps 74-80)
   - **Justification**: Once the arm is positioned above the plate, it needs to lower itself to place the bowl on the plate. This involves moving downward until the bowl is on the plate.
   
6. **Release the Bowl** (Steps 81-102)
   - **Justification**: After placing the bowl on the plate, the arm needs to release the bowl and return to a neutral position. This involves stopping to ensure the bowl is securely placed before releasing the grip.
