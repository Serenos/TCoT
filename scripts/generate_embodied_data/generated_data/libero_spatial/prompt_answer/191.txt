### Task Description

**Task Overview:**
The task is to pick up a black bowl that is placed on a cookie box and then place it on a plate. Both the cookie box and the plate are located on a table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, move to the plate, and finally release the bowl onto the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Navigate to the black bowl:** The robotic arm needs to move forward to reach the black bowl on the cookie box.
2. **Grasp the black bowl:** Once the arm is close enough, it needs to move down to grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the black bowl:** After grasping the bowl, the arm must move up to lift it off the cookie box.
4. **Navigate to the plate:** The arm then needs to move left to reach the plate.
5. **Place the black bowl on the plate:** Finally, the arm should move down to place the bowl on the plate.

**Intervals of High-Level Movements:**
- **Navigate to the black bowl:** Steps 9-25
- **Grasp the black bowl:** Steps 26-38
- **Lift the black bowl:** Steps 55-58
- **Navigate to the plate:** Steps 64-68
- **Place the black bowl on the plate:** Steps 72-78

### High-Level Plan Justification

**Plan:**
1. **Navigate to the black bowl:** Move forward to reach the black bowl on the cookie box.
2. **Grasp the black bowl:** Move down to grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the black bowl:** Move up to lift the bowl off the cookie box.
4. **Navigate to the plate:** Move left to reach the plate.
5. **Place the black bowl on the plate:** Move down to place the bowl on the plate.

**Justification:**
- **Navigate to the black bowl:** The black bowl is on the cookie box, which is in front of the robot. Moving forward is necessary to reach the bowl.
- **Grasp the black bowl:** Once the arm is close to the bowl, moving down is required to grasp it.
- **Lift the black bowl:** After grasping the bowl, moving up is necessary to lift it off the cookie box.
- **Navigate to the plate:** The plate is to the left of the robot. Moving left is required to reach the plate.
- **Place the black bowl on the plate:** Once the arm is above the plate, moving down is necessary to place the bowl on it.
