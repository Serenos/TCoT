### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl from a ramekin and placing it on a white plate located on the table. The environment consists of the following objects and their relative positions:
- **Black Bowl**: Initially on a ramekin.
- **Ramekin**: Positioned on the table.
- **White Plate**: Also positioned on the table, at a different location from the ramekin.
- **Robotic Arm**: Controlled by the policy to execute the task.

#### High-Level Movements and Justification

Based on the task and the trajectory provided, the high-level movements executed by the robotic arm can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the Black Bowl**:
   - **Interval**: Steps 15-28
   - **Justification**: The arm needs to move down to reach the black bowl on the ramekin. This is necessary to position the gripper close enough to grasp the bowl.

2. **Grasp the Black Bowl**:
   - **Interval**: Steps 29-48
   - **Justification**: After reaching the bowl, the arm needs to stop and prepare to grasp the bowl. This involves ensuring the gripper is correctly positioned and stable before lifting the bowl.

3. **Lift the Black Bowl**:
   - **Interval**: Steps 49-50
   - **Justification**: Once the bowl is grasped, the arm needs to lift it up to clear the ramekin and any potential obstacles on the table.

4. **Move to the White Plate**:
   - **Interval**: Steps 61-70
   - **Justification**: After lifting the bowl, the arm needs to move forward to reach the white plate. This involves navigating to the correct position on the table where the plate is located.

5. **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate**:
   - **Interval**: Steps 71-78
   - **Justification**: Once the arm is above the plate, it needs to move down to place the bowl on the plate. This ensures the bowl is securely placed without dropping it.

6. **Final Stop**:
   - **Interval**: Steps 79-90
   - **Justification**: After placing the bowl, the arm needs to stop to complete the task and ensure no further movement occurs.
