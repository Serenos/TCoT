### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl from the center of the table and place it on a plate. The environment includes a black bowl, a white bowl, a red and white striped bowl, a wooden cabinet with drawers, and a silver box, all located on the table. The black bowl is the target object, and the plate is the destination.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Move to the black bowl** (Steps 12-17)
2. **Move down to grasp the black bowl** (Steps 26-41)
3. **Move back to the starting position** (Steps 79-84)
4. **Move down to place the black bowl on the plate** (Steps 90-96)

#### Plan for the Solution
The high-level plan for completing the task is:
1. Move the robotic arm to the location of the black bowl.
2. Lower the arm to grasp the black bowl.
3. Move the arm back to the starting position.
4. Lower the arm to place the black bowl on the plate.
