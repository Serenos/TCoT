### Task Description

The task is to pick up a black bowl from the center of the table and place it on a plate. The environment consists of a table where a black bowl is located near a plate, and a white bowl is located near a red and white striped plate. The goal is to manipulate the robotic arm to perform the necessary movements to achieve the task.

### High-Level Movements and Plan

Based on the task and the trajectory executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the black bowl**: The robotic arm needs to move towards the black bowl, which is located at the center of the table.
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: Once the arm is close enough to the black bowl, it needs to grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the black bowl**: After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to lift it off the table.
4. **Move to the plate**: The arm then needs to move the black bowl towards the plate.
5. **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Finally, the arm should release the bowl onto the plate.

#### Intervals of High-Level Movements

- **Approach the black bowl**: Steps 0-20
- **Grasp the black bowl**: Steps 21-27
- **Lift the black bowl**: Steps 28-62
- **Move to the plate**: Steps 63-64
- **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Steps 65-109

### Justification for High-Level Movements

- **Approach the black bowl**: The arm must approach the black bowl to be in position to grasp it. This involves moving the arm down to reach the bowl's height.
- **Grasp the black bowl**: Once the arm is in position, it needs to grasp the bowl securely to prevent it from slipping.
- **Lift the black bowl**: After grasping, the arm must lift the bowl to clear the table surface and prepare for the next movement.
- **Move to the plate**: The arm needs to move horizontally to align with the plate's position.
- **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Finally, the arm should lower the bowl onto the plate and release it.
