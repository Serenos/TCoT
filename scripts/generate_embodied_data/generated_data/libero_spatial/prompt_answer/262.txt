### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The robotic arm is tasked with picking up a black bowl located on a wooden cabinet and placing it on a white plate situated on a wooden table. The environment includes a wooden cabinet with the black bowl on it, a wooden table with the white plate, and the robotic arm positioned at an initial location.

**High-Level Movements:**
Based on the executed trajectory, the high-level movements that were performed can be summarized as follows:
1. **Move Forward**: The robotic arm moved forward to approach the wooden cabinet where the black bowl is located.
2. **Move Left**: After reaching the front of the cabinet, the robotic arm moved left to align itself with the position of the black bowl.
3. **Move Left Down**: The robotic arm then moved diagonally left and down to reach the bowl.
4. **Move Down**: Finally, the robotic arm moved straight down to grasp the bowl.

**Intervals and Justifications:**
- **Move Forward (Steps 29-31):** The robotic arm needed to move forward to get closer to the wooden cabinet where the black bowl is located.
- **Move Left (Steps 70-92):** Once the robotic arm was in front of the cabinet, it needed to move left to align itself with the position of the black bowl.
- **Move Left Down (Steps 94-96):** To reach the bowl, the robotic arm moved diagonally left and down.
- **Move Down (Steps 97-109):** The final movement was to move straight down to grasp the bowl.
