### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task involves a robotic arm interacting with objects on a table. Specifically, the robot must **pick up a black bowl located next to a ramekin and place it on a white plate**. The objects are arranged such that the black bowl is positioned near the ramekin, and the white plate is also on the table, but at a different location. The robot must navigate its way to the black bowl, grasp it, and then navigate to the white plate to place the bowl down.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals:

1. **Move Left**: Steps 12-27
   - Justification: The robot needs to move horizontally towards the black bowl, which is to the left of its initial position.
2. **Move Down**: Steps 33-49
   - Justification: After reaching the horizontal position of the black bowl, the robot needs to lower its arm to reach the bowl.
3. **Move Up**: Steps 70-79
   - Justification: Once the bowl is grasped, the robot needs to lift the bowl off the table.
4. **Move Forward**: Steps 83-86, 93-94
   - Justification: The robot needs to move forward towards the white plate.
5. **Move Down**: Steps 107-110
   - Justification: The robot lowers the bowl onto the white plate.

#### Plan for Solution
The high-level plan for completing the task is as follows:
1. Move the arm to the left to align with the black bowl.
2. Move the arm down to reach the black bowl.
3. Grasp the black bowl.
4. Move the arm up to lift the black bowl.
5. Move the arm forward to align with the white plate.
6. Move the arm down to place the black bowl on the white plate.
