### Task Overview

The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl that is placed on a cookie box and then place the bowl on a plate. Both the cookie box and the plate are located on a table. The robotic arm must navigate to the bowl, grasp it, lift it, navigate to the plate, and finally place the bowl on the plate.

### High-Level Movements and Justifications

Based on the executed trajectory and the task description, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Navigate to the Bowl** (Steps 8-24): The robotic arm moves forward to reach the position where the black bowl is located on the cookie box.
   - **Justification**: The bowl is initially out of reach, so the arm must move forward to get close enough to grasp it.

2. **Lower Arm to Grasp the Bowl** (Steps 25-34): The robotic arm moves forward and downward to position itself correctly to grasp the bowl.
   - **Justification**: Once the arm is close to the bowl, it needs to lower itself to the correct height to grasp the bowl without knocking it over.

3. **Lift the Bowl** (Steps 52-58): The robotic arm lifts the bowl off the cookie box.
   - **Justification**: After grasping the bowl, the arm must lift it to clear the cookie box and prepare for the next movement.

4. **Navigate to the Plate** (Steps 64-70): The robotic arm moves left to align itself with the plate.
   - **Justification**: The plate is to the left of the initial position, so the arm must move left to reach it.

5. **Lower Arm to Place the Bowl** (Steps 71-78): The robotic arm moves downward to place the bowl on the plate.
   - **Justification**: Once aligned with the plate, the arm must lower itself to place the bowl gently on the plate.

6. **Final Adjustments** (Steps 79-98): The robotic arm makes final adjustments and stops.
   - **Justification**: After placing the bowl, the arm may need to make minor adjustments to ensure the bowl is properly placed and then stop.
