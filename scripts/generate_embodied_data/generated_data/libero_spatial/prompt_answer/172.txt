### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl that is initially placed on a ramekin and then place it on a white plate. The environment consists of a silver bowl on a ramekin, a white plate on the table, and the black bowl that needs to be moved. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, and then move it to the white plate.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features` dictionary, the high-level movements that were executed are:
1. **Approach the black bowl** (Steps 10-11)
2. **Move down to grasp the black bowl** (Steps 21-25)
3. **Move forward to the white plate** (Steps 98-108)

#### Plan for Solution
The high-level plan for completing the task is:
1. **Approach the black bowl**: Move the robotic arm closer to the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: Move the robotic arm down to pick up the black bowl.
3. **Move to the white plate**: Move the robotic arm forward to the white plate.
4. **Place the black bowl on the white plate**: Lower the robotic arm to place the black bowl on the white plate.
