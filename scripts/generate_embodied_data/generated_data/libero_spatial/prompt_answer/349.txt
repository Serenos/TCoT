### Task Overview

The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl located on a cookie box and place it on a plate, both of which are on a table. The robotic arm must navigate to the bowl, grasp it, lift it, move to the plate, and release the bowl onto the plate.

### High-Level Movements and Justifications

Based on the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Navigate to the Bowl**
   - Steps: 7-23
   - Justification: The robot needs to move forward to reach the bowl on the cookie box. This is necessary to position the arm correctly for grasping the bowl.

2. **Lower Arm to Grasp the Bowl**
   - Steps: 28-39
   - Justification: Once the arm is positioned over the bowl, it needs to move downward to grasp the bowl. This ensures that the gripper can securely hold the bowl.

3. **Lift the Bowl**
   - Steps: 53-56
   - Justification: After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to move upward to lift the bowl off the cookie box. This prevents the bowl from being dragged along the surface.

4. **Move Left to Avoid Obstacles**
   - Steps: 66-68
   - Justification: To avoid any obstacles or to align with the plate's position, the arm moves left. This ensures a clear path to the plate.

5. **Lower Arm to Place the Bowl on the Plate**
   - Steps: 74-78
   - Justification: Once aligned with the plate, the arm moves downward to place the bowl on the plate. This ensures the bowl is placed accurately and safely.

6. **Lift Arm Away from the Plate**
   - Steps: 88-91
   - Justification: After placing the bowl, the arm needs to move upward to lift away from the plate. This completes the task and prepares the arm for the next action.
