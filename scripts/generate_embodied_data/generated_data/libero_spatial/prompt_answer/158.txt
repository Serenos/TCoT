### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task is to pick up a black bowl from a wooden cabinet and place it on a white plate located on a wooden table. The black bowl is initially on the wooden cabinet, and the white plate is on the wooden table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, and then navigate to the white plate to place the bowl on it.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move to the black bowl on the wooden cabinet:**
   - Steps: 63-99
   - Justification: The robotic arm needs to position itself above the black bowl to prepare for grasping it. This involves moving up to avoid obstacles and then moving left to align with the bowl's position.

2. **Grasp the black bowl:**
   - Steps: 100-117
   - Justification: Once the arm is positioned above the bowl, it needs to move down to grasp the bowl securely.

3. **Move to the white plate on the wooden table:**
   - Steps: 118-134
   - Justification: After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to lift it and move to the white plate's location. This involves stopping to ensure stability and then moving to the plate.
