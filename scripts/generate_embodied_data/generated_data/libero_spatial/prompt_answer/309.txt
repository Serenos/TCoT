### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl from a cookie box and placing it on a plate. The black bowl is initially located on top of the cookie box, which is placed on a table. The plate is also on the table, and the goal is to move the black bowl from the cookie box to the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Approach the Cookie Box:** The robotic arm needs to move towards the cookie box to reach the black bowl.
2. **Pick Up the Black Bowl:** Once the arm is close enough, it needs to lower itself to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl:** After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to lift it up to clear the cookie box.
4. **Move to the Plate:** The arm then needs to move towards the plate.
5. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate:** Finally, the arm should lower itself to place the black bowl on the plate.

**Step Intervals for High-Level Movements:**
- **Approach the Cookie Box:** Steps 9-23
- **Pick Up the Black Bowl:** Steps 24-38
- **Lift the Black Bowl:** Steps 55-58
- **Move to the Plate:** Steps 71-76
- **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate:** Steps 77-99

### High-Level Plan Justification

**Plan:**
1. **Approach the Cookie Box:** The arm must move forward to reach the black bowl on the cookie box.
2. **Pick Up the Black Bowl:** Once the arm is in position, it must move down to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl:** After grasping the bowl, the arm must move up to lift it off the cookie box.
4. **Move to the Plate:** The arm must then move towards the plate.
5. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate:** Finally, the arm must move down to place the bowl on the plate.
