### Task Description

**Task Overview:**
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl located next to a cookie box and place it on a nearby plate. The environment consists of the black bowl, the cookie box, and the plate. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, and then move it to the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Navigate to the black bowl:** The robotic arm moves forward to reach the black bowl.
2. **Lift the black bowl:** Once at the bowl, the arm moves up to lift the bowl.
3. **Move to the plate:** After lifting the bowl, the arm moves left to reach the plate.
4. **Place the black bowl on the plate:** Finally, the arm places the bowl on the plate.

**Intervals and Justifications:**
1. **Navigate to the black bowl:**
   - **Interval:** Steps 9 to 26
   - **Justification:** The arm needs to move forward to reach the black bowl, which is located next to the cookie box. This movement is necessary to position the arm correctly for grasping the bowl.

2. **Lift the black bowl:**
   - **Interval:** Steps 61 to 63
   - **Justification:** Once the arm is positioned over the black bowl, it needs to move up to lift the bowl. This movement ensures that the bowl is securely grasped and lifted off the surface.

3. **Move to the plate:**
   - **Interval:** Steps 69 to 84
   - **Justification:** After lifting the bowl, the arm needs to move left to reach the plate. This movement is necessary to position the arm over the plate for placing the bowl.

4. **Place the black bowl on the plate:**
   - **Interval:** Steps 85 to 132
   - **Justification:** Once the arm is over the plate, it needs to stop and ensure the bowl is placed correctly on the plate. This movement ensures that the task is completed successfully.
