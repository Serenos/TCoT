### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task is to **pick up the black bowl between the plate and the ramekin and place it on the plate**. The environment consists of a wooden table with a black bowl, a white plate, and a red and white striped ramekin. The black bowl is located between the plate and the ramekin. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, pick it up, and then place it on the white plate.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Navigate to the black bowl**: Move the arm to the position where the black bowl is located.
2. **Pick up the black bowl**: Grasp the black bowl.
3. **Navigate to the white plate**: Move the arm to the position where the white plate is located.
4. **Place the black bowl on the white plate**: Release the black bowl onto the white plate.

#### High-Level Plan
- **Navigate to the black bowl**: Steps 0-11
- **Pick up the black bowl**: Steps 12-30
- **Navigate to the white plate**: Steps 31-70
- **Place the black bowl on the white plate**: Steps 71-99
