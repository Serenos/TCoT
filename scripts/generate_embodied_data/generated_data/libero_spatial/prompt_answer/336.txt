### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The robotic arm's task is to pick up a black bowl located between a white plate and a grey ramekin and place it on the white plate. The objects are arranged on a wooden table. The black bowl is positioned such that the robotic arm must navigate around the ramekin and the plate to reach it, then lift it and place it on the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Approach the black bowl:** The robotic arm moves forward to reach the position of the black bowl.
2. **Lower the arm to grasp the black bowl:** Once the arm is above the black bowl, it moves downward to grasp it.
3. **Lift the black bowl:** After grasping the bowl, the arm moves upward to lift it off the table.
4. **Move to the white plate:** The arm then moves forward to reach the position of the white plate.
5. **Place the black bowl on the white plate:** Finally, the arm lowers itself to place the black bowl on the white plate.

**Step Intervals and Justifications:**

1. **Approach the black bowl (Steps 6-20):**
   - **Justification:** The black bowl is located between the plate and the ramekin. The arm must move forward to reach the bowl without colliding with the ramekin or the plate.

2. **Lower the arm to grasp the black bowl (Steps 30-40):**
   - **Justification:** Once the arm is above the black bowl, it must move downward to grasp the bowl securely.

3. **Lift the black bowl (Steps 60-61):**
   - **Justification:** After grasping the bowl, the arm must move upward to lift it off the table, ensuring it is clear of any obstacles.

4. **Move to the white plate (Steps 65-69):**
   - **Justification:** With the black bowl lifted, the arm must move forward to reach the position of the white plate.

5. **Place the black bowl on the white plate (Steps 70-95):**
   - **Justification:** Once the arm is above the white plate, it must lower itself to place the black bowl on the plate, completing the task.
