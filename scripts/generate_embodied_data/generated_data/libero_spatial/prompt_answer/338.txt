### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl located next to a white plate on a wooden table and place it on the white plate. The environment includes a metal machine and a black file cabinet, which are not directly relevant to the task but may serve as potential obstacles or reference points.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements recorded in the `trajectory_features`, the high-level movements executed by the robotic arm can be summarized as follows:

1. **Initial Positioning**: The robotic arm starts at a neutral position and needs to move to a position above the black bowl.
   - Steps: 67-72 (Move up)
   - Justification: The arm needs to clear any obstacles and position itself above the bowl to prepare for the pick-up.

2. **Approaching the Bowl**: Once above the bowl, the arm moves horizontally to align with the bowl's position.
   - Steps: 73-79 (Move right)
   - Justification: The bowl is to the right of the initial position, so the arm must move right to reach it.

3. **Picking Up the Bowl**: After aligning with the bowl, the arm would typically execute a downward movement to grasp the bowl, followed by lifting it.
   - Steps: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied by the context.
   - Justification: The bowl must be picked up before it can be placed on the plate.

4. **Moving to the Plate**: With the bowl in hand, the arm moves to the position above the white plate.
   - Steps: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied by the context.
   - Justification: The bowl must be moved to the plate to complete the task.

5. **Placing the Bowl**: The arm lowers the bowl onto the plate and releases it.
   - Steps: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied by the context.
   - Justification: The final step to complete the task is to place the bowl on the plate.

6. **Returning to Neutral Position**: After placing the bowl, the arm returns to a neutral position.
   - Steps: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied by the context.
   - Justification: Returning to a neutral position is a standard procedure to reset the arm for the next task.
