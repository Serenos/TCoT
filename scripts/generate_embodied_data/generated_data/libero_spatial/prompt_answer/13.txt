### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl located next to a cookie box and place it on a nearby plate. The environment contains at least three key objects: the black bowl, the cookie box, and the plate. The black bowl is positioned next to the cookie box, and the plate is located in another area of the environment. The goal is to navigate the robotic arm to the black bowl, grasp it, and then navigate to the plate to place the bowl on it.

### High-Level Movements and Justifications

Based on the executed trajectory and the task, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals and justifications:

1. **Move Forward to Reach the Black Bowl (Steps 4-27)**
   - **Justification:** The robotic arm needs to move forward to reach the black bowl, which is initially out of its reach. This movement is necessary to align the arm's gripper with the bowl for grasping.
   
2. **Stop to Prepare for Grasping (Steps 28-43)**
   - **Justification:** After reaching the bowl, the arm needs to stop to prepare for the grasping action. This pause ensures that the arm is stable and in the correct position before attempting to grasp the bowl.
   
3. **Move Down to Grasp the Black Bowl (Steps 44-46)**
   - **Justification:** Once the arm is aligned with the bowl, it needs to move downward to grasp the bowl. This movement is essential to bring the gripper close enough to the bowl to secure it.
   
4. **Stop to Secure the Grasp (Steps 47-63)**
   - **Justification:** After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to stop to ensure that the bowl is securely held. This pause helps to confirm that the bowl is firmly in the gripper before moving it.
   
5. **Move Left to Navigate to the Plate (Steps 72-83)**
   - **Justification:** With the bowl secured, the arm needs to move left to navigate towards the plate. This movement is necessary to align the arm with the plate for placing the bowl.
   
6. **Stop to Prepare for Placing the Bowl (Steps 84-112)**
   - **Justification:** After reaching the plate, the arm needs to stop to prepare for the placement action. This pause ensures that the arm is stable and in the correct position before releasing the bowl onto the plate.
