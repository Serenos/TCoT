### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task is to control a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl that is next to a white plate on a table and place it on the plate. The environment consists of a table with a black bowl and a white plate positioned next to each other. The robotic arm must navigate to the bowl, grasp it, lift it, move it over to the plate, and release it onto the plate.

#### High-Level Movements and Justification
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the Bowl** (Steps 40-43): The robotic arm moves downward to reach the height of the bowl.
2. **Lift the Bowl** (Steps 61-67): The robotic arm moves upward to lift the bowl off the table.
3. **Approach the Plate** (Steps 82-89): The robotic arm moves downward again to reach the height of the plate.
4. **Place the Bowl on the Plate** (Step 90 onwards): The robotic arm stops, indicating the bowl has been placed on the plate.

### Plan for the Solution
The high-level plan for completing the task is:
1. Move the robotic arm downward to reach the height of the bowl.
2. Lift the bowl off the table.
3. Move the robotic arm downward to reach the height of the plate.
4. Place the bowl on the plate.
