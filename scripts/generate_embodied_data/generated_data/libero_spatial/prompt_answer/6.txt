### Task Description

**Task Overview:**
The robotic arm is tasked with picking up a black bowl from the stove and placing it on a white plate located on a table. The black bowl is initially positioned on the stove, and the white plate is on the table. The goal is to move the bowl from the stove to the plate without dropping it or colliding with any obstacles.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Approach the Bowl:** The robotic arm needs to move downward to reach the height of the bowl on the stove.
2. **Grasp the Bowl:** Once at the correct height, the robotic arm should grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the Bowl:** After grasping the bowl, the arm should lift it off the stove.
4. **Move to the Plate:** The arm should then move horizontally to position itself over the plate on the table.
5. **Place the Bowl:** Finally, the arm should lower the bowl onto the plate and release it.

**Intervals of High-Level Movements:**
- **Approach the Bowl:** Steps 10-20
- **Grasp the Bowl:** Steps 21-105 (Note: The exact steps for grasping are not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but we can infer that the grasping occurs during this interval)
- **Lift the Bowl:** Steps 106-106 (Assuming the bowl is lifted immediately after grasping)
- **Move to the Plate:** Steps 107-123 (No horizontal movement is shown, but we can assume the arm is preparing for the next step)
- **Place the Bowl:** Steps 107-123 (No explicit placement is shown, but the arm is likely preparing to place the bowl)

### Plan for the Solution

**Plan:**
1. **Approach the Bowl:** Move the robotic arm downward to reach the bowl on the stove.
2. **Grasp the Bowl:** Grasp the bowl once the arm is at the correct height.
3. **Lift the Bowl:** Lift the bowl off the stove.
4. **Move to the Plate:** Move the arm horizontally to position it over the plate on the table.
5. **Place the Bowl:** Lower the bowl onto the plate and release it.
