### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task involves a robotic arm that must **pick up a black bowl located between a white plate and a red and white striped ramekin** and then **place the black bowl on the white plate**. The objects are placed on a wooden table. The robotic arm must navigate the environment, avoid obstacles, and execute precise movements to achieve the task.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals:
1. **Approach the black bowl**: Steps 8-19
2. **Move down to grasp the black bowl**: Steps 24-37
3. **Lift the black bowl**: Steps 52-57
4. **Move forward to the white plate**: Steps 60-65
5. **Move down to place the black bowl on the white plate**: Steps 74-77
6. **Lift the arm after placing the black bowl**: Steps 88-90

#### Plan for the Solution
- **Approach the black bowl**: Move the arm forward to reach the position where the black bowl is located.
- **Grasp the black bowl**: Move the arm down to the height of the black bowl and close the gripper to grasp it.
- **Lift the black bowl**: Move the arm up to lift the black bowl off the table.
- **Move to the white plate**: Move the arm forward to reach the position of the white plate.
- **Place the black bowl on the white plate**: Move the arm down to the height of the white plate and open the gripper to release the black bowl.
- **Lift the arm**: Move the arm up to return to a safe position.
