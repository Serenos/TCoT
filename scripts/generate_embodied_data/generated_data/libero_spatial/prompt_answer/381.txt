### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl located between a white plate and a red and white striped ramekin on a wooden table, and then place the bowl on the white plate. The objects are arranged such that the black bowl is positioned between the plate and the ramekin, requiring the robotic arm to navigate carefully to avoid obstacles and perform the task accurately.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the Black Bowl** (Steps 8-18): The robotic arm moves forward to reach the position where the black bowl is located.
2. **Lower the Arm to Pick Up the Bowl** (Steps 19-36): The arm moves downward to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the Arm with the Bowl** (Steps 57-58): The arm moves upward to lift the bowl off the table.
4. **Move to the White Plate** (Steps 65-66): The arm moves forward again to reach the position of the white plate.
5. **Lower the Arm to Place the Bowl** (Steps 74-77): The arm moves downward to place the bowl on the white plate.

### Plan for the Solution
The plan for completing the task involves the following high-level steps:
- **Approach the Black Bowl**: Move the arm forward to reach the black bowl.
- **Pick Up the Black Bowl**: Lower the arm to grasp the bowl and lift it.
- **Move to the White Plate**: Move the arm forward to reach the white plate.
- **Place the Black Bowl**: Lower the arm to place the bowl on the plate.
