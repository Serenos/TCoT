### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task is to pick up the black bowl next to the cookie box and place it on the plate. The environment consists of a table with a silver bowl, a red and white cookie box, and a black bowl next to the cookie box. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, and then move it to the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move towards the black bowl**: The robotic arm needs to navigate to the black bowl, which is next to the cookie box.
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: Once the arm is close enough to the black bowl, it needs to grasp it.
3. **Move towards the plate**: After grasping the black bowl, the arm needs to navigate to the plate.
4. **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Finally, the arm needs to release the black bowl onto the plate.

**Intervals of High-Level Movements:**
- **Move towards the black bowl**: Steps 16-31
- **Grasp the black bowl**: Steps 68-85
- **Move towards the plate**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory
- **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory

### Plan for the Solution

**Plan:**
1. Move the robotic arm forward to reach the black bowl.
2. Move the robotic arm up to position it above the black bowl.
3. Move the robotic arm left to align it with the black bowl.
4. Grasp the black bowl.
5. Move the robotic arm back to the starting position or towards the plate (not shown in the trajectory).
