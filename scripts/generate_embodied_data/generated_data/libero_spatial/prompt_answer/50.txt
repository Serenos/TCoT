### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
- **Activity:** The task involves moving a black bowl from the stove to a plate on a wooden table.
- **Objects Involved:**
  - **Black Bowl:** Initially located on the stove.
  - **Plate:** Located on the wooden table.
  - **Stove:** Positioned next to the wooden table.
  - **Silver Bowl:** Also on the stove, but not relevant to the task.
- **Objective:** The robotic arm must pick up the black bowl from the stove and place it on the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Approach the Black Bowl on the Stove:**
   - Steps: 0-13
   - Justification: The robotic arm needs to position itself above the black bowl on the stove to prepare for picking it up.
2. **Move Down to Pick Up the Black Bowl:**
   - Steps: 14-21
   - Justification: Once above the black bowl, the arm must move downward to grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl:**
   - Steps: 22-35
   - Justification: After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to lift it to clear the stove surface.
4. **Move to the Plate on the Wooden Table:**
   - Steps: 36-139
   - Justification: The arm must navigate to the plate on the wooden table while holding the black bowl.
5. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate:**
   - Steps: 140-140 (not present in the trajectory)
   - Justification: Once above the plate, the arm should release the black bowl onto the plate.

### High-Level Plan

**Remaining Task:**
- **Pick up the black bowl from the stove and place it on the plate.**

**Plan:**
1. Approach the black bowl on the stove.
2. Move down to pick up the black bowl.
3. Lift the black bowl.
4. Move to the plate on the wooden table.
5. Place the black bowl on the plate.
