### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm that must interact with objects in its environment to achieve a specific goal. The goal is to **pick up the black bowl next to the ramekin and place it on the plate**. The environment contains the following objects:
- A black bowl
- A ramekin
- A plate

The black bowl is positioned next to the ramekin, and the plate is located nearby. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, and then move it to the plate.

### High-Level Movements and Plan

Based on the executed trajectory, the high-level movements and plan can be broken down as follows:

1. **Move to the black bowl**: The robotic arm must first move horizontally to reach the position of the black bowl.
2. **Lower the arm to grasp the black bowl**: Once the arm is above the black bowl, it must lower itself to grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the black bowl**: After grasping the bowl, the arm must lift it to clear any obstacles.
4. **Move to the plate**: The arm must then move horizontally to reach the position of the plate.
5. **Lower the arm to place the black bowl on the plate**: Finally, the arm must lower itself to place the black bowl on the plate.

#### Intervals for High-Level Movements

1. **Move to the black bowl**: Steps 7-31
2. **Lower the arm to grasp the black bowl**: Steps 36-44
3. **Lift the black bowl**: Steps 71-75
4. **Move to the plate**: Steps 81-96
5. **Lower the arm to place the black bowl on the plate**: Steps 103-106

### Justification for High-Level Movements

1. **Move to the black bowl**:
   - **Justification**: The black bowl is the target object, and the arm must reach it to grasp it. Moving left is necessary to align the arm with the bowl's position.
   
2. **Lower the arm to grasp the black bowl**:
   - **Justification**: Once the arm is above the black bowl, lowering it is required to make contact and grasp the bowl. This ensures the bowl is securely held before lifting it.

3. **Lift the black bowl**:
   - **Justification**: Lifting the bowl is necessary to clear any obstacles and prepare for moving it to the plate. This ensures the bowl is not dragged along the surface.

4. **Move to the plate**:
   - **Justification**: After lifting the bowl, the arm must move horizontally to reach the plate. Moving forward is necessary to align the arm with the plate's position.

5. **Lower the arm to place the black bowl on the plate**:
   - **Justification**: Once the arm is above the plate, lowering it is required to place the bowl on the plate. This ensures the bowl is placed gently and accurately.
