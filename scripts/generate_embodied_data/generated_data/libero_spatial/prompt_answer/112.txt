### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl located in the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and place it on a plate. The environment consists of a table with three bowls and a stack of plates, and a wooden cabinet with a drawer positioned against the wall. The table is in front of the cabinet. The robot starts at an initial position and must navigate to the cabinet, open the drawer, retrieve the black bowl, and then navigate back to the table to place the bowl on a plate.

### High-Level Movements and Plan

Based on the executed trajectory, the high-level movements and the corresponding intervals of steps are as follows:

1. **Move towards the cabinet**: Steps 7-25
   - **Justification**: The robot needs to reach the cabinet to access the top drawer where the black bowl is located. The initial position is far from the cabinet, so moving forward is necessary.

2. **Move up to align with the top drawer**: Steps 70-77
   - **Justification**: Once the robot reaches the cabinet, it needs to move up to align with the height of the top drawer to open it and retrieve the black bowl.

3. **Move left to align with the drawer handle**: Steps 81-95
   - **Justification**: After aligning vertically with the drawer, the robot needs to move horizontally to the left to reach the handle of the drawer.

4. **Move down to open the drawer**: Steps 96-107
   - **Justification**: Once aligned with the drawer handle, the robot needs to move down to grasp and open the drawer.

5. **Move towards the table**: Steps 108-155
   - **Justification**: After retrieving the black bowl, the robot needs to return to the table to place the bowl on a plate. The table is in front of the cabinet, so moving forward again is necessary.
