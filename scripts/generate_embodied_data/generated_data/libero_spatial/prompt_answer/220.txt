### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
- **Activity:** Picking up the black bowl from the ramekin and placing it on the white plate.
- **Objects Involved:**
  - **Black Bowl:** Initially located on the ramekin.
  - **Ramekin:** A small dish where the black bowl is initially placed.
  - **White Plate:** Located on the table, where the black bowl needs to be placed.
- **Environment:**
  - The robot starts in a position where it can reach the ramekin and the white plate.
  - The ramekin is positioned such that the robot must move down to reach the black bowl.
  - The white plate is positioned such that the robot must move forward after picking up the black bowl to place it on the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move Down to Reach the Black Bowl (Steps 22-26):**
   - The robot needs to lower its arm to reach the black bowl on the ramekin.
2. **Move Up to Lift the Black Bowl (Steps 57-58):**
   - After picking up the black bowl, the robot needs to lift it off the ramekin.
3. **Move Forward to Reach the White Plate (Steps 76-85):**
   - The robot needs to move forward to reach the white plate and place the black bowl on it.

**Plan for Solution:**
- **High-Level Plan:**
  - Move down to reach the black bowl.
  - Pick up the black bowl.
  - Move up to lift the black bowl.
  - Move forward to reach the white plate.
  - Place the black bowl on the white plate.
