### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl located next to a ramekin and place it on a nearby plate. The environment consists of the black bowl, the ramekin, and the plate. The black bowl is positioned to the left of the ramekin, and the plate is positioned in front of the robot.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move Left**: The robotic arm moves left to align itself with the black bowl.
2. **Move Down**: The robotic arm moves down to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Move Up**: The robotic arm moves up to lift the black bowl.
4. **Move Forward**: The robotic arm moves forward to place the black bowl on the plate.

**Step Intervals and Justifications:**
1. **Move Left (Steps 6-26):** The robotic arm needs to move left to align with the black bowl, which is positioned to the left of the ramekin.
2. **Move Down (Steps 38-45):** After aligning with the black bowl, the robotic arm moves down to grasp the bowl.
3. **Move Up (Steps 74-81):** Once the black bowl is grasped, the robotic arm moves up to lift it.
4. **Move Forward (Steps 84-95):** Finally, the robotic arm moves forward to place the black bowl on the plate.
