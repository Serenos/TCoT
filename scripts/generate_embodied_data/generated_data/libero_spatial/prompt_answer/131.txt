### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm, specifically a silver robot arm, which is required to pick up a black bowl from the table and place it on a white plate with a red stripe. The black bowl is initially located next to the plate, and both objects are on the table.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features` dictionary, the high-level movements that were most likely executed are:
1. **Approach the black bowl**: Move the robotic arm towards the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: Pick up the black bowl.
3. **Move the black bowl to the plate**: Lift the black bowl and move it over to the white plate.
4. **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Release the black bowl onto the white plate.
5. **Retract the arm**: Move the robotic arm away from the plate and back to a neutral position.

#### Intervals and Justifications for High-Level Movements
1. **Approach the black bowl**: Steps 0-10
   - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to move towards the black bowl to be in position to grasp it.
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: Steps 11-20
   - **Justification**: Once the arm is in position, it needs to grasp the black bowl securely.
3. **Move the black bowl to the plate**: Steps 21-30
   - **Justification**: After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to lift it and move it over to the white plate.
4. **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Steps 31-40
   - **Justification**: The arm needs to release the black bowl onto the white plate to complete the task.
5. **Retract the arm**: Steps 41-121
   - **Justification**: Finally, the arm needs to move away from the plate to a neutral position to signal the completion of the task.
