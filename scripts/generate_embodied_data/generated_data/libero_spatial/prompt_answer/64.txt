### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves moving a black bowl from the stove to a plate on a wooden table. The environment consists of a stove where a black bowl is initially placed, and a wooden table where a plate is located. The stove is positioned next to the table. The goal is to pick up the black bowl from the stove and place it on the plate on the table.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features`, the high-level movements that were most likely executed are:
1. **Move the arm over the black bowl on the stove** (Steps 0-22)
2. **Lower the arm to grasp the black bowl** (Steps 23-31)
3. **Lift the black bowl from the stove** (Steps 32-55)
4. **Move the arm with the black bowl to the plate on the table** (Steps 56-134)

### Plan for the Solution
The plan to complete the task is as follows:
1. **Approach the black bowl on the stove**.
2. **Grasp the black bowl**.
3. **Lift the black bowl from the stove**.
4. **Move the black bowl to the plate on the table**.
5. **Place the black bowl on the plate**.
