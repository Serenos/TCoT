### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl located between a white plate and a red and white striped ramekin on a wooden table, and then place the bowl on the white plate. The environment is static, and the objects are positioned such that the bowl is accessible but requires careful navigation to avoid collisions with the ramekin and the plate.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the executed trajectory and the task description, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals and steps:

1. **Move to the Bowl** (Steps 8-20): The robotic arm moves forward to reach the position of the black bowl.
2. **Lower Arm to Pick Up the Bowl** (Steps 22-40): The robotic arm moves downward to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the Bowl** (Steps 58-62): The robotic arm moves upward to lift the bowl off the table.
4. **Move to the Plate** (Steps 76-79): The robotic arm moves downward to position itself above the white plate.
5. **Place the Bowl on the Plate** (Steps 95-96): The robotic arm moves upward to release the bowl onto the plate.

### Plan for the Solution
- **Move to the Bowl**: Navigate the robotic arm to the position of the black bowl.
- **Lower Arm to Pick Up the Bowl**: Position the gripper to grasp the bowl.
- **Lift the Bowl**: Raise the bowl off the table to clear any obstacles.
- **Move to the Plate**: Navigate the robotic arm to the position above the white plate.
- **Place the Bowl on the Plate**: Release the bowl onto the plate.
