### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl that is placed on a cookie box, both of which are on a table, and placing the bowl on a plate that is also on the table. The environment is static, meaning the positions of the objects do not change during the execution of the task. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, navigate to the plate, and place the bowl on the plate.

### High-Level Movements and Justifications

Based on the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the Black Bowl**: The robotic arm moves forward to reach the black bowl.
   - **Steps**: 8-24
   - **Justification**: The arm must approach the black bowl to be able to grasp it. Moving forward is necessary to reduce the distance between the arm and the bowl.

2. **Lower the Arm to Grasp the Bowl**: The robotic arm moves downward to reach the height of the bowl.
   - **Steps**: 25-36
   - **Justification**: Once the arm is close enough to the bowl, it needs to lower itself to the correct height to grasp the bowl without knocking it over.

3. **Lift the Bowl**: The robotic arm lifts the bowl after grasping it.
   - **Steps**: 52-58
   - **Justification**: After grasping the bowl, the arm must lift it to clear the cookie box and prepare for moving it to the plate.

4. **Move to the Plate**: The robotic arm moves left to reach the plate.
   - **Steps**: 63-66
   - **Justification**: The plate is located to the left of the bowl, so the arm must move left to align with the plate.

5. **Lower the Arm to Place the Bowl**: The robotic arm moves downward to place the bowl on the plate.
   - **Steps**: 70-78
   - **Justification**: To place the bowl on the plate, the arm must lower itself to the height of the plate and release the bowl.
