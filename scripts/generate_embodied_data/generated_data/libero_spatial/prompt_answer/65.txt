### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl located on a wooden cabinet and place it on a white plate situated on a wooden table. The environment consists of the following key elements:
- **Black Bowl**: Located on the wooden cabinet.
- **Wooden Cabinet**: A piece of furniture where the black bowl is initially placed.
- **White Plate**: Located on the wooden table.
- **Wooden Table**: A piece of furniture where the white plate is placed.
- **Robotic Arm**: The agent responsible for executing the task.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Move to the Wooden Cabinet**: The robotic arm needs to position itself in front of the wooden cabinet to reach the black bowl.
   - Steps: 30-33
2. **Move Down to Reach the Black Bowl**: Once in front of the cabinet, the arm needs to move downward to grasp the black bowl.
   - Steps: 37-40
3. **Move Left to Align with the Black Bowl**: After reaching the black bowl, the arm needs to move left to align itself properly for grasping.
   - Steps: 75-106
4. **Move Down to Grasp the Black Bowl**: The arm needs to move further down to grasp the black bowl.
   - Steps: 107-126
5. **Move to the Wooden Table**: After grasping the black bowl, the arm needs to move to the wooden table to place the bowl on the white plate.
   - Steps: (Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied)
6. **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate**: Once at the wooden table, the arm needs to release the black bowl onto the white plate.
   - Steps: (Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied)

#### Plan for the Solution
The high-level plan for completing the task is as follows:
1. Move to the wooden cabinet.
2. Move down to reach the black bowl.
3. Move left to align with the black bowl.
4. Move down to grasp the black bowl.
5. Move to the wooden table.
6. Place the black bowl on the white plate.
