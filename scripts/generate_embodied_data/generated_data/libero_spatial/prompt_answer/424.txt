### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl from a ramekin and place it on a plate. The environment consists of a table where a ramekin is placed, and the ramekin contains a black bowl. The plate is also on the table, and the goal is to move the black bowl from the ramekin to the plate.

#### High-Level Movements and Justifications

1. **Initial Positioning (Steps 0-20)**
   - **Plan**: Move the arm to a starting position above the ramekin.
   - **Justification**: Before picking up the bowl, the arm needs to be positioned correctly to ensure it can reach the bowl without colliding with other objects.

2. **Approaching the Bowl (Steps 21-68)**
   - **Plan**: Move the arm downward to reach the bowl.
   - **Justification**: The bowl is on the ramekin, so the arm must move downward to get close enough to grasp the bowl.

3. **Grasping the Bowl (Steps 69-119)**
   - **Plan**: Move the arm forward and downward to grasp the bowl.
   - **Justification**: After reaching the bowl, the arm needs to move forward and downward to securely grasp the bowl.

4. **Lifting the Bowl (Steps 120-137)**
   - **Plan**: Move the arm upward and away from the ramekin to lift the bowl.
   - **Justification**: Once the bowl is grasped, the arm must lift it to prevent it from being placed back on the ramekin.
