### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task is to pick up a black bowl from a ramekin and place it on a plate. The black bowl is initially located on a ramekin, which is itself placed on a plate. The robotic arm must navigate to the bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then place it on the plate.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Approach the Bowl**: Move the robotic arm to the position above the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the Bowl**: Lower the arm to grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the Bowl**: Raise the arm to lift the bowl off the ramekin.
4. **Move to the Plate**: Navigate the arm to the position above the plate.
5. **Place the Bowl**: Lower the arm to place the bowl on the plate.

#### Intervals of High-Level Movements
1. **Approach the Bowl**: Steps 0-63
2. **Grasp the Bowl**: Steps 64-85
3. **Lift the Bowl**: Steps 86-109
4. **Move to the Plate**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory (assumed to be part of the lifting process)
5. **Place the Bowl**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory (assumed to be part of the lifting process)

### High-Level Plan Justification
- **Approach the Bowl**: The arm needs to move to the position above the black bowl to prepare for grasping.
- **Grasp the Bowl**: The arm needs to lower itself to the bowl to grasp it securely.
- **Lift the Bowl**: The arm needs to lift the bowl to clear the ramekin and prepare for moving it to the plate.
- **Move to the Plate**: The arm needs to navigate to the position above the plate to prepare for placing the bowl.
- **Place the Bowl**: The arm needs to lower itself to the plate to place the bowl.
