### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task is to pick up a black bowl that is placed on a cookie box and then place it on a plate. The black bowl and the cookie box are located on a table, and the plate is also on the same table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, move it over to the plate, and release it onto the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Approach the Black Bowl:** The robotic arm must move forward to reach the black bowl on the cookie box.
2. **Lower the Arm to Grasp the Bowl:** Once the arm is above the bowl, it must move downward to grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the Bowl:** After grasping the bowl, the arm must lift it up to clear the cookie box.
4. **Move to the Plate:** The arm must then move to the location of the plate.
5. **Lower the Arm to Place the Bowl:** The arm must move downward to place the bowl on the plate.
6. **Release the Bowl:** Finally, the arm releases the bowl onto the plate.

**Step Intervals for High-Level Movements:**
- **Approach the Black Bowl:** Steps 6-23
- **Lower the Arm to Grasp the Bowl:** Steps 25-34
- **Lift the Bowl:** Steps 51-54
- **Move to the Plate:** Steps 69-72
- **Lower the Arm to Place the Bowl:** Steps 70-72 (Note: This overlaps with the previous step, but it's a distinct subtask)
- **Release the Bowl:** Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied after step 72

**Justification for High-Level Movements:**
- **Approach the Black Bowl:** The arm must move forward to reach the black bowl, which is the first step in the task.
- **Lower the Arm to Grasp the Bowl:** The arm must lower itself to grasp the bowl, which is necessary to pick it up.
- **Lift the Bowl:** Lifting the bowl is required to clear the cookie box and prepare for moving it to the plate.
- **Move to the Plate:** The arm must move to the plate to place the bowl.
- **Lower the Arm to Place the Bowl:** Lowering the arm is necessary to place the bowl on the plate.
- **Release the Bowl:** Releasing the bowl completes the task.
