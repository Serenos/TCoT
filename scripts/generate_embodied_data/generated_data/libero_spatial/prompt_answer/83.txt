### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl located between a plate and a ramekin and place it on the plate. The environment contains the following objects:
- A black bowl between the plate and the ramekin.
- A plate.
- A ramekin.
- A silver bowl on the table (which is not directly relevant to the task).

#### High-Level Movements and Plan
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Approach the black bowl**: Move the robotic arm towards the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: Position the gripper to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the black bowl**: Raise the black bowl off the table.
4. **Move to the plate**: Move the robotic arm towards the plate.
5. **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Position the gripper to release the black bowl onto the plate.

#### Intervals and Justifications for High-Level Movements
1. **Approach the black bowl**:
   - Steps: 4-17
   - Justification: The robotic arm needs to move forward to reach the black bowl, which is initially far away.

2. **Grasp the black bowl**:
   - Steps: 18-35
   - Justification: The robotic arm needs to move down to reach the black bowl and then stop to ensure it is in position to grasp it.

3. **Lift the black bowl**:
   - Steps: 36-65
   - Justification: The robotic arm needs to lift the black bowl off the table, which involves moving up and down to ensure a stable grip.

4. **Move to the plate**:
   - Steps: 66-85
   - Justification: The robotic arm needs to move forward and up to reach the plate, which is in a different location.

5. **Place the black bowl on the plate**:
   - Steps: 86-111
   - Justification: The robotic arm needs to move down to place the black bowl on the plate and then stop to ensure it is placed correctly.
