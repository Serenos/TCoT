### Task Description

**Task Overview:**
The robotic arm's task is to pick up a black bowl from the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and place it on a white plate. The environment contains a wooden cabinet with drawers, a table with a black bowl, a silver bowl, a white plate, and a red and white striped plate. The task involves navigating to the cabinet, opening the top drawer, picking up the black bowl, navigating back to the table, and placing the bowl on the white plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Navigate to the Cabinet:** The robot must move forward to reach the wooden cabinet.
2. **Open the Top Drawer:** Once at the cabinet, the robot must move its arm up to reach the handle of the top drawer and open it.
3. **Pick Up the Black Bowl:** After opening the drawer, the robot must move its arm into the drawer, locate the black bowl, and pick it up.
4. **Navigate Back to the Table:** The robot must then move its arm down and back to the table.
5. **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate:** Finally, the robot must place the black bowl on the white plate.

**Intervals of High-Level Movements:**
- **Navigate to the Cabinet:** Steps 6-22
- **Open the Top Drawer:** Steps 68-77
- **Pick Up the Black Bowl:** Steps 83-115
- **Navigate Back to the Table:** Steps 103-115 (Note: This overlaps with the previous step as the robot moves down to prepare for the next action)
- **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate:** Steps 103-115 (Continuation of the previous step)

### Plan for the Solution

**Plan:**
1. Move forward to the wooden cabinet.
2. Move up to open the top drawer.
3. Move left to position the arm over the black bowl.
4. Move down to pick up the black bowl.
5. Move back to the table.
6. Place the black bowl on the white plate.
