### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl from a cookie box and place it on a plate. The black bowl is initially located on the cookie box, which is placed on a table. The plate is also on the table, but at a different location. The goal is to navigate the robotic arm to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the plate and release it.

#### High-Level Movements and Justifications
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Move towards the black bowl on the cookie box** (Steps 5-24):
   - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to reach the black bowl to pick it up. This involves moving forward to align the gripper with the bowl's position.
   
2. **Stop and prepare to grasp the black bowl** (Steps 25-32):
   - **Justification**: After reaching the bowl, the arm needs to stop and lower itself to the correct height to grasp the bowl without knocking it over.
   
3. **Lift the black bowl** (Steps 33-58):
   - **Justification**: Once the bowl is grasped, the arm needs to lift it up to clear any obstacles and prepare for the next movement.
   
4. **Move towards the plate** (Steps 59-72):
   - **Justification**: After lifting the bowl, the arm needs to move horizontally to align with the plate's position.
   
5. **Lower the black bowl onto the plate** (Steps 73-75):
   - **Justification**: The arm needs to lower the bowl onto the plate carefully to ensure it is placed correctly.
   
6. **Stop and release the black bowl** (Steps 76-94):
   - **Justification**: Once the bowl is on the plate, the arm needs to stop and release the bowl, completing the task.
