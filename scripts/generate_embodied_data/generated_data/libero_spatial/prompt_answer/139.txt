### Task Description

**Task Overview:**
The task is to control a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl from a wooden cabinet and place it on a white plate located on a wooden table. The black bowl is initially on the wooden cabinet, and the white plate is on the wooden table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, and then move it to the white plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move to the Black Bowl:** The robotic arm needs to position itself in front of the black bowl on the wooden cabinet.
2. **Grasp the Black Bowl:** Once in position, the arm must grasp the black bowl.
3. **Move to the White Plate:** After grasping the bowl, the arm must navigate to the white plate on the wooden table.
4. **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate:** Finally, the arm must release the black bowl onto the white plate.

**Intervals and Justifications:**
- **Move to the Black Bowl:** Steps 37-85
  - **Justification:** The arm needs to move backward and then up and left to position itself in front of the black bowl.
- **Grasp the Black Bowl:** Steps 86-108
  - **Justification:** The arm needs to move down to reach the black bowl and grasp it.
- **Move to the White Plate:** Steps 109-139
  - **Justification:** The arm needs to move down further to navigate to the white plate on the wooden table.
- **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate:** Steps 109-139 (same as moving to the white plate)
  - **Justification:** The arm needs to release the black bowl onto the white plate once it is in position.
