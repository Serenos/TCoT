### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
- **Activity:** The robotic arm is tasked with picking up a black bowl and placing it on a white plate.
- **Objects Involved:**
  - **Black Bowl:** Located next to the white plate on a table.
  - **White Plate:** Positioned on the table, adjacent to the black bowl.
- **Environment:** The task is performed on a flat surface (table) with no additional obstacles mentioned.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Approach the Black Bowl:** Move the robotic arm to the position where the black bowl is located.
2. **Pick Up the Black Bowl:** Execute the necessary actions to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Move the Black Bowl to the White Plate:** Transport the black bowl to the position of the white plate.
4. **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate:** Release the black bowl onto the white plate.

**High-Level Plan:**
- **Step 1:** Approach the black bowl.
  - **Interval:** Steps 18-46
- **Step 2:** Pick up the black bowl.
  - **Interval:** Steps 47-60 (No specific movement, assumed to be grasping)
- **Step 3:** Move the black bowl to the white plate.
  - **Interval:** Steps 61-83
- **Step 4:** Place the black bowl on the white plate.
  - **Interval:** Steps 84-94
