### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl from the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and place it on a white plate located on a nearby countertop. The environment consists of a wooden cabinet with drawers, a countertop, and a white plate. The robotic arm must navigate through the space, open the top drawer, retrieve the black bowl, and then place it on the white plate.

#### High-Level Movements and Justification
Based on the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals and justifications:

1. **Move Forward (Steps 7-19)**
   - **Justification:** The robot starts at a position far from the wooden cabinet. To reach the cabinet, it needs to move forward until it is close enough to interact with the drawer.
   
2. **Move Up (Steps 59-67)**
   - **Justification:** Once the robot is in front of the cabinet, it needs to move its arm up to reach the handle of the top drawer. This movement ensures that the arm is positioned correctly to open the drawer.

3. **Move Left (Steps 73-91)**
   - **Justification:** After reaching the height of the drawer handle, the robot needs to move its arm left to align with the handle. This ensures that the arm is in the correct position to grasp and open the drawer.

4. **Move Down (Steps 95-103)**
   - **Justification:** Once the drawer is open, the robot needs to move its arm down to reach the black bowl inside the drawer. This movement ensures that the arm can grasp the bowl without hitting the drawer's bottom.

5. **Stop (All other steps)**
   - **Justification:** The robot stops at various points to ensure stability, to wait for the drawer to fully open, to reposition itself, and to prepare for the next movement.

### Plan for the Solution
- **High-Level Plan:**
  1. Move forward to the wooden cabinet.
  2. Move up to reach the handle of the top drawer.
  3. Move left to align with the drawer handle.
  4. Move down to reach the black bowl inside the drawer.
  5. Pick up the black bowl.
  6. Move back to the white plate.
  7. Place the black bowl on the white plate.
