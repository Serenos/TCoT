### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task is to **pick up the black bowl from the ramekin and place it on the plate**. The environment consists of a black bowl placed on a ramekin, which is itself placed on a plate. The robotic arm must navigate to the bowl, grasp it, lift it, move it over to the plate, and release it.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the executed trajectory and the task, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Move to the Bowl**: The robot needs to move its arm to the position where the black bowl is located on the ramekin.
   - Steps: 6-12, 20-30
2. **Grasp the Bowl**: Once the arm is in position, the robot needs to grasp the bowl.
   - Steps: 31-49
3. **Lift the Bowl**: After grasping the bowl, the robot needs to lift it off the ramekin.
   - Steps: 50-52
4. **Move to the Plate**: The robot then needs to move the bowl to the plate.
   - Steps: 53-70
5. **Place the Bowl**: Finally, the robot needs to lower the bowl onto the plate and release it.
   - Steps: 73-77
6. **Retract the Arm**: After placing the bowl, the robot retracts its arm.
   - Steps: 96-99

### High-Level Plan
The high-level plan for completing the task is as follows:
1. Move to the bowl.
2. Grasp the bowl.
3. Lift the bowl.
4. Move to the plate.
5. Place the bowl.
6. Retract the arm.
