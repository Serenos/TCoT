### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task is to control a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl that is placed on a ramekin and then place it on a white plate. The environment includes a wooden table, a black bowl on a ramekin, a white plate, two metal containers, and a dark brown file cabinet with three drawers.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move to the black bowl on the ramekin:**
   - Steps 68-80: Move forward to reach the black bowl.
   - Step 81: Move forward and down to position the gripper above the bowl.
   - Steps 82-84: Move down to grasp the bowl.

2. **Pick up the black bowl:**
   - Steps 85-107: Stop to ensure the bowl is securely grasped.

**Justification for High-Level Movements:**
- **Move to the black bowl on the ramekin:**
  - The robotic arm needs to move forward to reach the black bowl, which is located on the ramekin. This is necessary to position the gripper above the bowl.
  - Once the arm is close enough, it needs to move forward and down to align the gripper with the bowl.
  - Finally, the arm moves down to grasp the bowl.

- **Pick up the black bowl:**
  - After the bowl is grasped, the arm stops to ensure that the bowl is securely held before any further movements are made.
