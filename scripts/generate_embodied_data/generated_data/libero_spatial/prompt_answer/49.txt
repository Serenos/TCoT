### Task Overview

The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl from the center of the table and place it on a white paper plate, which is also on the table. The black bowl and the white paper plate are the primary objects of interest. The black bowl is initially located at the center of the table, and the white paper plate is nearby. The goal is to execute a series of movements that will allow the robotic arm to grasp the black bowl, lift it, and place it on the white paper plate.

### High-Level Movements and Plan

Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Approach the black bowl**: Move the robotic arm towards the black bowl located at the center of the table.
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: Once the arm is in position, grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the black bowl**: Lift the black bowl off the table.
4. **Move to the white paper plate**: Move the robotic arm with the black bowl towards the white paper plate.
5. **Place the black bowl on the white paper plate**: Release the black bowl onto the white paper plate.
6. **Retract the arm**: Move the robotic arm away from the white paper plate to a safe position.

### Interval of Steps for Each High-Level Movement

1. **Approach the black bowl**: Steps 0-12
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: Steps 13-21
3. **Lift the black bowl**: Steps 22-35
4. **Move to the white paper plate**: Steps 36-50
5. **Place the black bowl on the white paper plate**: Steps 51-65
6. **Retract the arm**: Steps 66-110

### Justification for Each High-Level Movement

1. **Approach the black bowl**: The robotic arm must first approach the black bowl to be in a position to grasp it. This involves moving the arm towards the center of the table where the bowl is located.
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: Once the arm is in position, it needs to grasp the black bowl securely to prepare for lifting.
3. **Lift the black bowl**: After grasping the bowl, the arm must lift it off the table to clear the surface and prepare for the next movement.
4. **Move to the white paper plate**: With the bowl lifted, the arm must move towards the white paper plate to position it for placement.
5. **Place the black bowl on the white paper plate**: Once the arm is in position over the plate, the bowl must be released onto the plate.
6. **Retract the arm**: Finally, the arm should move away from the plate to a safe position to avoid any interference.
