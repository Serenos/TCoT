### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task is to pick up a black bowl that is placed on a cookie box and then place it on a plate. Both the cookie box and the plate are located on a table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, move it to the plate, and release it.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Navigate to the black bowl**: The robot moves forward to reach the black bowl on the cookie box.
2. **Lift the black bowl**: The robot moves up to position itself above the black bowl.
3. **Move to the plate**: The robot moves left and then down to position itself above the plate.
4. **Place the black bowl on the plate**: The robot releases the black bowl onto the plate.

#### Intervals of Steps for Each High-Level Movement
1. **Navigate to the black bowl**: Steps 7-26
2. **Lift the black bowl**: Steps 57-61
3. **Move to the plate**: Steps 67-70 (left), Steps 73-80 (down)
4. **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Steps 81-93

#### Justification for Each High-Level Movement
1. **Navigate to the black bowl**: The robot needs to move forward to reach the black bowl on the cookie box. This is necessary to get close enough to grasp the bowl.
2. **Lift the black bowl**: Once the robot is positioned above the bowl, it needs to move up to lift the bowl off the cookie box. This ensures that the bowl is clear of any obstacles.
3. **Move to the plate**: After lifting the bowl, the robot needs to move left and then down to position itself above the plate. This is necessary to align the bowl with the target location.
4. **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Finally, the robot needs to release the bowl onto the plate. This completes the task.
