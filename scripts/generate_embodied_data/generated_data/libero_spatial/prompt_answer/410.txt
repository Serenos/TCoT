### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task is to pick up a black bowl located next to a white plate on a wooden table and place it on the white plate. The environment also contains a metal container and a red box, which are not directly involved in the task but could potentially serve as obstacles.

**High-Level Movements:**
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals:

1. **Approach the black bowl (Steps 32-47):**
   - The robot moves its arm downward to approach the black bowl, which is initially positioned at a higher level.
   
2. **Move the arm to the side of the black bowl (Steps 75-79):**
   - After reaching the height of the black bowl, the robot moves its arm to the right to position itself next to the bowl.

3. **Pick up the black bowl (Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied):**
   - The robot would typically execute a grasping action to pick up the black bowl. This step is not explicitly shown in the trajectory but is necessary for the task.

4. **Move the black bowl to the white plate (Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied):**
   - The robot would then move the black bowl to the white plate, which is also not explicitly shown in the trajectory but is necessary for the task.

5. **Place the black bowl on the white plate (Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied):**
   - Finally, the robot would release the black bowl onto the white plate, completing the task.

### Plan for the Solution

**Plan:**
1. Move the arm downward to reach the height of the black bowl.
2. Move the arm to the right to position it next to the black bowl.
3. Pick up the black bowl.
4. Move the black bowl to the white plate.
5. Place the black bowl on the white plate.
