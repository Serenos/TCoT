### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task is to control a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl that is located next to a ramekin and place it on a nearby plate. The environment contains the following objects:
- **Black Bowl:** Located next to the ramekin.
- **Ramekin:** Positioned near the black bowl.
- **Plate:** Positioned nearby, where the black bowl should be placed.

**High-Level Movements:**
Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements that were most likely executed are:
1. **Move Left:** To align the robotic arm with the black bowl.
2. **Move Down:** To lower the arm to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Move Up:** To lift the black bowl off the surface.
4. **Move Forward:** To position the arm over the plate.
5. **Move Down:** To lower the black bowl onto the plate.

**Intervals of High-Level Movements:**
- **Move Left:** Steps 4-24
- **Move Down:** Steps 30-42
- **Move Up:** Steps 63-71
- **Move Forward:** Steps 72-84
- **Move Down:** Steps 87-91

**Justification for High-Level Movements:**
- **Move Left:** The black bowl is initially positioned to the left of the robotic arm. Moving left is necessary to align the arm with the bowl.
- **Move Down:** After aligning with the bowl, the arm needs to move down to reach the bowl and grasp it.
- **Move Up:** Once the bowl is grasped, the arm must move up to lift the bowl off the surface.
- **Move Forward:** After lifting the bowl, the arm needs to move forward to position it over the plate.
- **Move Down:** Finally, the arm moves down to place the bowl on the plate.
