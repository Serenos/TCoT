### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl from a ramekin and place it on a plate. The black bowl is initially located on the ramekin, which is itself placed on the plate. The robotic arm must navigate to the bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then place it on the plate.

#### High-Level Movements and Justification
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the Bowl**: The robotic arm needs to move towards the bowl to be able to grasp it.
   - **Steps**: 70-81
   - **Justification**: The bowl is the target object, and the arm must first position itself correctly to grasp it.

2. **Grasp the Bowl**: Once the arm is in position, it needs to grasp the bowl.
   - **Steps**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied by the subsequent lifting motion.
   - **Justification**: Grasping the bowl is necessary to lift and move it.

3. **Lift the Bowl**: After grasping, the arm must lift the bowl to clear the ramekin.
   - **Steps**: 75-81
   - **Justification**: Lifting the bowl ensures it is clear of the ramekin and ready to be moved to the plate.

4. **Move to the Plate**: The arm must then move the bowl to the plate.
   - **Steps**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied by the context.
   - **Justification**: The final placement of the bowl on the plate completes the task.

5. **Place the Bowl on the Plate**: The arm must release the bowl onto the plate.
   - **Steps**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied by the context.
   - **Justification**: Placing the bowl on the plate is the final step to complete the task.
