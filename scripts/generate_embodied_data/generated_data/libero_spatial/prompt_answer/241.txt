### Task Description

**Task Overview:**
The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl located next to a cookie box and place it on a nearby plate. The environment consists of the black bowl, the cookie box, and the plate, with the black bowl being the primary object of interest for manipulation. The robotic arm must navigate through the space to reach the black bowl, grasp it, and then navigate to the plate to place the bowl on it.

**High-Level Movements:**
Based on the executed trajectory and the task, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals:
1. **Approach the black bowl:** Steps 8-30 (Move forward)
2. **Stop and prepare to grasp the bowl:** Steps 31-100 (Stop)
3. **Grasp the bowl:** Step 101 (Move down)
4. **Lift the bowl:** Steps 102-145 (Stop)

**Justification for High-Level Movements:**
1. **Approach the black bowl:** The robotic arm needs to move forward to reach the black bowl, which is the first step in the task. This movement is necessary to bring the arm within reach of the bowl.
2. **Stop and prepare to grasp the bowl:** Once the arm is close enough to the bowl, it stops to ensure it is in the correct position to grasp the bowl. This stop is crucial to avoid overshooting and to prepare for the grasping action.
3. **Grasp the bowl:** After stopping, the arm moves down to grasp the bowl. This downward movement is essential to securely pick up the bowl.
4. **Lift the bowl:** After grasping the bowl, the arm stops again to lift the bowl. This stop ensures that the bowl is securely held before moving it to the plate.
