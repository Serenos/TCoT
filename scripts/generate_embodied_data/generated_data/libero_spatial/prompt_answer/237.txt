### Task Description

The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl from a ramekin and place it on a plate. The environment consists of a black bowl placed on a ramekin, which is itself placed on a plate. The robotic arm must navigate to the bowl, grasp it, lift it off the ramekin, and then place it on the plate. The task requires careful planning to avoid knocking over the ramekin or dropping the bowl.

### High-Level Movements and Justifications

Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements and their corresponding intervals are as follows:

1. **Approach the Bowl** (Steps 20-29): The robotic arm moves downward to position itself above the black bowl.
   - **Justification**: The bowl is located on the ramekin, which is lower than the initial position of the robotic arm. Moving downward is necessary to align the gripper with the bowl's position.

2. **Move Forward to the Bowl** (Steps 75-82): The robotic arm moves forward to reach the bowl.
   - **Justification**: After positioning itself above the bowl, the arm needs to move forward to bring the gripper closer to the bowl for grasping.

3. **Grasp the Bowl** (Steps 93-96): The robotic arm moves downward again to grasp the bowl.
   - **Justification**: Once the gripper is aligned with the bowl, moving downward is necessary to make contact with the bowl and grasp it securely.

4. **Lift the Bowl** (Steps 97-130): The robotic arm stops after grasping the bowl, presumably to lift it and prepare for placing it on the plate.
   - **Justification**: Lifting the bowl is necessary to clear it from the ramekin and prepare for the final placement on the plate.

### Plan for the Solution

- **Approach the Bowl**: Move the robotic arm downward to position it above the black bowl.
- **Move Forward to the Bowl**: Move the robotic arm forward to align the gripper with the bowl.
- **Grasp the Bowl**: Move the robotic arm downward again to grasp the bowl.
- **Lift the Bowl**: Lift the bowl to clear it from the ramekin and prepare for placing it on the plate.
