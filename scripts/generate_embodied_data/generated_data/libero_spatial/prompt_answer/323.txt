### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl that is placed next to a white plate on a table and placing it on the white plate. The goal is to move the bowl from its initial position to the center of the plate without dropping it or colliding with any obstacles.

**Environment Description:**
- **Objects:**
  - **Black Bowl:** Initially positioned next to the white plate on the table.
  - **White Plate:** Positioned on the table, adjacent to the black bowl.
- **Table:** Flat surface where the bowl and plate are placed.
- **Robotic Arm:** Equipped with sensors and actuators to perform precise movements.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Approach the Bowl:** Move the robotic arm towards the black bowl to position the gripper above it.
2. **Grasp the Bowl:** Lower the gripper to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the Bowl:** Raise the gripper to lift the black bowl off the table.
4. **Move to the Plate:** Move the gripper horizontally to position the bowl above the white plate.
5. **Place the Bowl:** Lower the gripper to place the bowl on the white plate.
6. **Retract the Arm:** Move the gripper away from the plate to complete the task.

**Step Intervals for High-Level Movements:**
- **Approach the Bowl:** Steps 0-20
- **Grasp the Bowl:** Steps 21-38
- **Lift the Bowl:** Steps 39-59
- **Move to the Plate:** Steps 60-74
- **Place the Bowl:** Steps 75-89
- **Retract the Arm:** Steps 90-114

### High-Level Plan Justification

- **Approach the Bowl:**
  - **Justification:** The robotic arm must first approach the black bowl to position the gripper above it. This ensures that the gripper is in the correct position to grasp the bowl without colliding with any objects.
- **Grasp the Bowl:**
  - **Justification:** Once the gripper is positioned above the bowl, the arm must lower the gripper to grasp the bowl securely. This ensures that the bowl is firmly held before lifting it.
- **Lift the Bowl:**
  - **Justification:** After grasping the bowl, the arm must lift it off the table to clear the surface and prepare for moving it to the plate.
- **Move to the Plate:**
  - **Justification:** With the bowl lifted, the arm must move horizontally to position the bowl above the white plate. This ensures that the bowl is correctly aligned for placement.
- **Place the Bowl:**
  - **Justification:** Once the bowl is above the plate, the arm must lower the gripper to place the bowl gently on the plate. This ensures that the bowl is placed accurately and securely.
- **Retract the Arm:**
  - **Justification:** After placing the bowl, the arm must retract to complete the task and return to a safe position.
