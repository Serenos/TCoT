### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl from the stove and place it on a plate. The environment consists of a stove where a black bowl is located, a wooden table with a plate, and a silver bowl also on the stove. The stove is positioned next to the table.

**High-Level Movements:**
Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features`, the high-level movements executed by the robotic arm are as follows:
1. **Approach the Stove:** The robotic arm needs to move towards the stove to reach the black bowl.
2. **Pick Up the Black Bowl:** Once at the stove, the robotic arm must grasp the black bowl.
3. **Move to the Plate:** After picking up the black bowl, the robotic arm needs to move towards the plate on the wooden table.
4. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate:** Finally, the robotic arm should release the black bowl onto the plate.

**Intervals and Justifications:**
- **Approach the Stove:** Steps 0-14 (Initial stopping phase)
  - **Justification:** The robotic arm starts in a neutral position and needs to stop to prepare for the next movement.
- **Move Down to Reach the Black Bowl:** Steps 15-24
  - **Justification:** The robotic arm needs to move downwards to reach the black bowl on the stove.
- **Stop and Prepare to Pick Up the Black Bowl:** Steps 25-127
  - **Justification:** The robotic arm stops to stabilize its position and prepare for grasping the black bowl. This phase is extended due to the complexity of the grasping action, which requires precise control and stabilization.
