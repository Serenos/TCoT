### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl from the center of the table and place it on a plate. The environment includes a black bowl and a white bowl on the table, with the black bowl near the center and the white bowl near a red and white plate. The goal is to execute a sequence of movements that will allow the robotic arm to successfully complete the task while avoiding any obstacles.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Move Forward to Reach the Black Bowl** (Steps 10-18)
2. **Move Down to Grasp the Black Bowl** (Steps 25-29)
3. **Move Up to Lift the Black Bowl** (Steps 87-91)

#### Plan for the Solution
The high-level plan for completing the task is:
1. **Move Forward** to reach the black bowl.
2. **Move Down** to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Move Up** to lift the black bowl.
4. **Move Forward** to reach the plate.
5. **Move Down** to place the black bowl on the plate.
