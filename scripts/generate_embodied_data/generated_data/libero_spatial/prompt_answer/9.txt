### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task is to control a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl that is located on the stove and place it on a white plate that is located on the table. The environment includes the following objects and their relative locations:
- **Black Bowl:** On the stove.
- **White Plate:** On the table.
- **Robotic Arm:** Initially at a neutral position.

**High-Level Movements:**
Based on the task and the trajectory features provided, the high-level movements that were most likely executed are:
1. **Move to the Stove:** The robotic arm moves to the location of the black bowl on the stove.
2. **Pick Up the Black Bowl:** The robotic arm grasps the black bowl.
3. **Move to the Table:** The robotic arm moves to the location of the white plate on the table.
4. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate:** The robotic arm releases the black bowl onto the white plate.
5. **Return to Neutral Position:** The robotic arm returns to its initial neutral position.

**Intervals for High-Level Movements:**
- **Move to the Stove:** Steps 0-20
- **Pick Up the Black Bowl:** Steps 21-40
- **Move to the Table:** Steps 41-60
- **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate:** Steps 61-80
- **Return to Neutral Position:** Steps 81-147

### Plan for the Solution

**Plan:**
1. Move the robotic arm to the stove where the black bowl is located.
2. Pick up the black bowl.
3. Move the robotic arm to the table where the white plate is located.
4. Place the black bowl on the white plate.
5. Return the robotic arm to its initial neutral position.
