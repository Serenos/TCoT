### Task Description

**Task Overview:**
The task is to pick up a black bowl from the center of the table and place it on a plate. The environment contains a black bowl near a plate and a white bowl near a red and white striped plate. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, move it to the plate, and release it.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Approach the black bowl:** Move the arm towards the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the black bowl:** Position the gripper over the black bowl and close the gripper to grasp it.
3. **Lift the black bowl:** Move the arm upwards to lift the black bowl off the table.
4. **Move to the plate:** Navigate the arm to the location of the plate.
5. **Place the black bowl on the plate:** Position the gripper over the plate and open the gripper to release the black bowl.

**Intervals of High-Level Movements:**
- **Approach the black bowl:** Steps 0-102 (No movement, as the arm is already positioned)
- **Grasp the black bowl:** Steps 0-102 (No movement, as the arm is already positioned)
- **Lift the black bowl:** Steps 19-29
- **Move to the plate:** Steps 0-102 (No movement, as the arm is already positioned)
- **Place the black bowl on the plate:** Steps 0-102 (No movement, as the arm is already positioned)

**Justification for High-Level Movements:**
- **Approach the black bowl:** The arm needs to be positioned over the black bowl to grasp it.
- **Grasp the black bowl:** The gripper must be closed to securely hold the black bowl.
- **Lift the black bowl:** The arm must lift the black bowl to clear the table surface.
- **Move to the plate:** The arm must navigate to the plate to place the black bowl.
- **Place the black bowl on the plate:** The gripper must be opened to release the black bowl onto the plate.
