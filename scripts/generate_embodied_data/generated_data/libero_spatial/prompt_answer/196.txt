### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task is to **pick up a black bowl from a cookie box and place it on a white plate**. The black bowl is initially located on the cookie box, and the white plate is on the table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, move to the white plate, and place the bowl on the plate.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the executed trajectory and the task, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Move to the black bowl**: The robot needs to move towards the black bowl on the cookie box.
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: Once the robot is close enough, it needs to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the black bowl**: After grasping, the robot needs to lift the black bowl off the cookie box.
4. **Move to the white plate**: The robot then needs to navigate to the white plate on the table.
5. **Place the black bowl on the white plate**: Finally, the robot places the black bowl on the white plate.

#### Step Intervals and Justifications
- **Move to the black bowl**: Steps 6-23
  - **Justification**: The robot needs to move forward to reach the black bowl on the cookie box.
- **Grasp the black bowl**: Steps 24-32
  - **Justification**: The robot needs to move forward and down to align its gripper with the black bowl and grasp it.
- **Lift the black bowl**: Steps 51-57
  - **Justification**: The robot needs to move up to lift the black bowl off the cookie box.
- **Move to the white plate**: Steps 60-77
  - **Justification**: The robot needs to move left and down to reach the white plate on the table.
- **Place the black bowl on the white plate**: Steps 78-95
  - **Justification**: The robot needs to stop and place the black bowl on the white plate.
