### Task Description

The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl that is initially placed on a ramekin, which itself is on a plate, and then placing the bowl directly on the plate. The environment is static, with no moving objects or obstacles other than the robotic arm itself. The goal is to execute the task efficiently and safely, ensuring that the bowl is grasped securely and placed accurately on the plate without causing any damage to the objects or the environment.

### High-Level Movements and Plan

Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features` dictionary, the high-level movements executed by the robotic arm can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the Bowl**: The robotic arm moves down to reach the height of the bowl on the ramekin.
   - **Interval**: Steps 18-25
   - **Justification**: The bowl is located at a lower height than the initial position of the robotic arm. Moving down is necessary to align the gripper with the bowl for a secure grasp.

2. **Grasp the Bowl**: The robotic arm stops to simulate the action of grasping the bowl.
   - **Interval**: Steps 26-47
   - **Justification**: After reaching the bowl, the arm needs to pause to simulate the action of grasping the bowl. This ensures that the bowl is securely held before lifting it.

3. **Lift the Bowl**: The robotic arm moves up to lift the bowl off the ramekin.
   - **Interval**: Steps 48-51
   - **Justification**: Once the bowl is securely grasped, the arm must move up to lift the bowl off the ramekin and clear any potential obstacles.

4. **Place the Bowl on the Plate**: The robotic arm stops to simulate the action of placing the bowl on the plate.
   - **Interval**: Steps 52-100
   - **Justification**: After lifting the bowl, the arm needs to pause to simulate the action of placing the bowl on the plate. This ensures that the bowl is placed accurately and securely on the plate.

### Plan for the Solution

- **Approach the Bowl**: Move the arm down to the height of the bowl.
- **Grasp the Bowl**: Simulate the action of grasping the bowl.
- **Lift the Bowl**: Move the arm up to lift the bowl off the ramekin.
- **Place the Bowl on the Plate**: Simulate the action of placing the bowl on the plate.
