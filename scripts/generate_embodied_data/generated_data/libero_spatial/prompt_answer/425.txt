### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl from the center of the table and place it on a plate. The environment contains a black bowl and a white bowl on the table, with the black bowl near a plate and the white bowl near a red and white striped plate. The goal is to specifically interact with the black bowl and the plate, while avoiding any interference with the white bowl and the red and white striped plate.

#### High-Level Movements and Plan
Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the Black Bowl** (Steps 6-10): The robotic arm moves forward to reach the position where the black bowl is located.
2. **Lower the Arm to Pick Up the Black Bowl** (Steps 14-24): The robotic arm moves downward to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl** (Steps 25-45): The robotic arm lifts the black bowl off the table.
4. **Move to the Plate** (Steps 46-55): The robotic arm moves forward to reach the plate.
5. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate** (Steps 56-65): The robotic arm lowers the black bowl onto the plate.
6. **Retract the Arm** (Steps 66-116): The robotic arm moves back to its initial position or a safe position.

### High-Level Plan

2. Lower the arm to pick up the black bowl.
3. Lift the black bowl.
4. Move to the plate.
5. Place the black bowl on the plate.
6. Retract the arm.
