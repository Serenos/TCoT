### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl that is placed on a cookie box and placing it on a plate. Both the cookie box and the plate are located on a table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Approach the Black Bowl:** The robotic arm needs to move towards the black bowl on the cookie box.
2. **Grasp the Black Bowl:** Once the arm is close enough, it needs to lower itself to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl:** After grasping the bowl, the arm must lift it up.
4. **Move to the Plate:** The arm then needs to move towards the plate.
5. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate:** Finally, the arm places the black bowl on the plate.

**Intervals and Justifications:**

1. **Approach the Black Bowl (Steps 0-25):**
   - **Justification:** The robotic arm starts from a resting position and needs to move forward to reach the black bowl. The black bowl is on the cookie box, and the arm must navigate to this location to perform the task.

2. **Stop Before Grasping (Steps 26-35):**
   - **Justification:** After approaching the black bowl, the arm needs to stop to prepare for grasping. This ensures that the arm is in the correct position and orientation before attempting to pick up the bowl.

3. **Grasp the Black Bowl (Steps 36-39):**
   - **Justification:** The arm lowers itself to grasp the black bowl. This movement is necessary to ensure that the gripper can securely hold the bowl.

4. **Stop After Grasping (Steps 40-55):**
   - **Justification:** After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to stop again to ensure a stable grip before lifting the bowl.

5. **Lift the Black Bowl (Steps 56-60):**
   - **Justification:** The arm lifts the black bowl to clear the cookie box and prepare for moving it to the plate.

6. **Stop After Lifting (Steps 61-97):**
   - **Justification:** The arm stops after lifting the bowl to stabilize the movement and prepare for the next phase of the task.
