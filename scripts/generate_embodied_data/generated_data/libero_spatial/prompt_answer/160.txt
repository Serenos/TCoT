### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl located next to a cookie box and place it on a plate. The environment consists of a black bowl, a cookie box, and a plate, all of which are placed in a specific configuration. The black bowl is the primary object of interest, and the robotic arm must navigate to it, grasp it, and then move it to the plate.

#### High-Level Movements and Plan
Based on the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals:

1. **Initial Positioning (Steps 0-25)**
   - **Reasoning**: The robot starts in a stationary position and needs to move forward to reach the black bowl. The black bowl is located in front of the robot, and the robot must move forward to approach it.
   - **Steps**: 0-25

2. **Stopping Before the Bowl (Steps 26-64)**
   - **Reasoning**: After moving forward, the robot needs to stop to ensure it is in the correct position to grasp the black bowl. This stopping phase allows the robot to adjust its position and prepare for the grasping action.
   - **Steps**: 26-64

3. **Lifting the Arm (Steps 65-78)**
   - **Reasoning**: Once the robot is in position, it needs to lift its arm to avoid any potential obstacles and prepare for grasping the black bowl. Lifting the arm ensures that the robot can safely reach the bowl without colliding with other objects.
   - **Steps**: 65-78

4. **Moving Left to Grasp the Bowl (Steps 79-117)**
   - **Reasoning**: After lifting the arm, the robot needs to move left to align its gripper with the black bowl. Moving left is necessary to position the gripper correctly over the bowl for a secure grasp.
   - **Steps**: 79-117

#### Plan for the Solution
- **High-Level Steps**:
  1. Move forward to approach the black bowl.
  2. Stop to ensure correct positioning.
  3. Lift the arm to prepare for grasping.
  4. Move left to align the gripper with the black bowl.
  5. Grasp the black bowl.
  6. Move the black bowl to the plate.
  7. Place the black bowl on the plate.
