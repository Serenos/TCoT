### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl from a table and place it on a white plate with a red and white striped rim. The black bowl is located next to a ramekin, and the white plate is also on the table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the white plate and release it.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Move to the black bowl**: The robotic arm needs to position itself above the black bowl.
   - Steps: 0-26
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: The robotic arm needs to lower itself to grasp the black bowl.
   - Steps: 27-64
3. **Lift the black bowl**: The robotic arm needs to lift the black bowl off the table.
   - Steps: 65-77
4. **Move to the white plate**: The robotic arm needs to position itself above the white plate.
   - Steps: 78-117
5. **Place the black bowl on the white plate**: The robotic arm needs to lower itself to place the black bowl on the white plate.
   - Steps: 118-125

### Plan for the Solution
The high-level plan for completing the task is as follows:
1. Move the robotic arm to the black bowl.
2. Grasp the black bowl.
3. Lift the black bowl.
4. Move the robotic arm to the white plate.
5. Place the black bowl on the white plate.
