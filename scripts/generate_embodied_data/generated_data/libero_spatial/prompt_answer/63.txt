### Task Overview

The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl from a cookie box and place it on a plate. Both the cookie box and the plate are located on a table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, move to the plate, and release the bowl onto the plate.

### High-Level Movements and Plan

Based on the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals:

1. **Navigation to the Black Bowl** (Steps 7-24): The robotic arm moves forward to reach the black bowl.
2. **Approach and Grasp the Black Bowl** (Steps 25-33): The robotic arm moves down to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl** (Steps 34-74): The robotic arm lifts the black bowl and stops to stabilize the grip.
4. **Move to the Plate** (Steps 75-76): The robotic arm moves down to reach the plate.
5. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate** (Steps 77-98): The robotic arm stops to place the black bowl on the plate.

### Plan for the Solution

The high-level plan for completing the task is as follows:
- **Navigate to the Black Bowl**: Move the robotic arm forward to reach the black bowl.
- **Approach and Grasp the Black Bowl**: Move the robotic arm down to grasp the black bowl.
- **Lift the Black Bowl**: Lift the black bowl to clear the cookie box.
- **Move to the Plate**: Move the robotic arm to the plate.
- **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate**: Release the black bowl onto the plate.
