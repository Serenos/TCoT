### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
- **Activity:** The robotic arm's task is to pick up the black bowl that is currently on a white plate and place it next to a silver bowl, which is also located next to the white plate.
- **Objects Involved:**
  - **Black Bowl:** Initially positioned on the white plate.
  - **White Plate:** Serves as the initial location of the black bowl and the target location where the black bowl will be placed after the task is completed.
  - **Silver Bowl:** Located next to the white plate, serving as the reference point for the final placement of the black bowl.
- **Relative Locations:**
  - The black bowl is initially on the white plate.
  - The silver bowl is next to the white plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move Left:** The robotic arm moves left to position itself over the black bowl.
   - **Interval:** Steps 18-20
   - **Justification:** The black bowl is initially on the white plate, and moving left aligns the arm with the bowl.
2. **Move Down:** The robotic arm moves down to reach the black bowl.
   - **Interval:** Steps 27-36
   - **Justification:** After aligning horizontally, the arm needs to move down to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Move Up:** The robotic arm moves up to lift the black bowl off the white plate.
   - **Interval:** Steps 60-64
   - **Justification:** Once the black bowl is grasped, the arm needs to lift it to prepare for the next movement.
4. **Move Down:** The robotic arm moves down to place the black bowl next to the silver bowl.
   - **Interval:** Steps 79-84
   - **Justification:** After lifting the black bowl, the arm needs to move down to place it next to the silver bowl.

**High-Level Plan:**
- **Plan:**
  1. Move left to align with the black bowl.
  2. Move down to grasp the black bowl.
  3. Move up to lift the black bowl.
  4. Move down to place the black bowl next to the silver bowl.
