### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task

The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl from the stove and place it on a white plate located on a wooden table. The environment consists of the following key elements:
- **Black Bowl**: Located on the stove.
- **White Plate**: Located on the wooden table.
- **Stove**: The surface where the black bowl is initially placed.
- **Wooden Table**: The surface where the white plate is located.

#### High-Level Movements

Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features` dictionary, the high-level movements that were most likely executed are:
1. **Approach the Stove**: Move the robotic arm towards the stove to reach the black bowl.
2. **Pick Up the Black Bowl**: Grasp the black bowl from the stove.
3. **Move to the Wooden Table**: Transport the black bowl from the stove to the wooden table.
4. **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate**: Release the black bowl onto the white plate.

#### Interval of Steps for Each High-Level Movement

1. **Approach the Stove**: Steps 0-20
2. **Pick Up the Black Bowl**: Steps 21-40
3. **Move to the Wooden Table**: Steps 41-60
4. **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate**: Steps 61-80

#### Justification for Each High-Level Movement

1. **Approach the Stove**: The robotic arm must move towards the stove to reach the black bowl, which is the first object to interact with.
2. **Pick Up the Black Bowl**: Once the arm is near the black bowl, it needs to grasp it to prepare for the next step.
3. **Move to the Wooden Table**: After picking up the black bowl, the arm must transport it to the wooden table where the white plate is located.
4. **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate**: Finally, the black bowl must be released onto the white plate to complete the task.
