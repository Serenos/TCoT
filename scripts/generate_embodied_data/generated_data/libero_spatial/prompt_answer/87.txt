### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl from the table and place it on a white plate with a red border, which is also on the table. The environment consists of a wooden table where both the black bowl and the white plate are located. The robotic arm is initially positioned above the table, and its goal is to navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, move it over to the white plate, and release it onto the plate.

### High-Level Movements

Based on the executed trajectory, the high-level movements that the robotic arm performed are as follows:

1. **Move Down to Reach the Black Bowl (Steps 52-56)**: The robotic arm moves downward to reach the position of the black bowl.
2. **Move Up to Lift the Black Bowl (Steps 74-82)**: After grasping the black bowl, the robotic arm moves upward to lift the bowl off the table.
3. **Move Right to Position Over the White Plate (Steps 83-86)**: The robotic arm moves to the right to position itself over the white plate.
4. **Move Down to Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate (Steps 91-96)**: The robotic arm moves downward to place the black bowl on the white plate.

### Plan for the Solution

The high-level plan for completing the task is as follows:

1. **Approach the Black Bowl**: Move the robotic arm downward to reach the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the Black Bowl**: Once the arm is close enough, grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl**: Move the arm upward to lift the black bowl off the table.
4. **Move to the White Plate**: Move the arm to the right to position it over the white plate.
5. **Place the Black Bowl**: Move the arm downward to place the black bowl on the white plate.
