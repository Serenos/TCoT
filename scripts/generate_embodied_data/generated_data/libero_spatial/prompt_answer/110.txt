### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl from a table and placing it on a white plate. The black bowl is located next to a red and yellow cookie box. The environment is a table with these objects placed in specific positions. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, and then move it to the white plate.

#### High-Level Movements and Justification
Based on the executed trajectory and the task, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Move Forward to Reach the Black Bowl** (Steps 8-23)
   - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to move forward to reach the black bowl, which is located some distance away from its initial position. This movement is necessary to bring the arm close enough to the bowl to pick it up.

2. **Stop to Prepare for Lifting the Bowl** (Steps 24-70)
   - **Justification**: After reaching the bowl, the arm needs to stop to prepare for the next action, which is lifting the bowl. This pause ensures that the arm is in the correct position and stable before attempting to grasp the bowl.

3. **Move Up to Lift the Bowl** (Steps 71-74)
   - **Justification**: Once the arm is positioned correctly, it needs to move up to lift the black bowl off the table. This movement is necessary to clear the bowl from the table surface and prepare for the next step.

4. **Stop to Prepare for Moving the Bowl** (Steps 75-100)
   - **Justification**: After lifting the bowl, the arm needs to stop again to prepare for moving the bowl to the white plate. This pause ensures that the bowl is securely held and the arm is stable before moving it.

5. **Move Left to Reach the White Plate** (Steps 101-108)
   - **Justification**: The white plate is located to the left of the bowl. The arm needs to move left to reach the plate and place the bowl on it. This movement is necessary to align the arm with the target location.

6. **Stop to Complete the Task** (Steps 109-121)
   - **Justification**: After placing the bowl on the plate, the arm stops to complete the task. This final stop indicates that the task has been successfully completed.
