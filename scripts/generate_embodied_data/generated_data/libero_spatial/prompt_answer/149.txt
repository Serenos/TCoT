### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task is to pick up a black bowl located between a white plate and a silver ramekin and place it on the white plate. The environment includes a black bowl, a white plate, a silver ramekin, and a dark brown wooden box with three drawers. The black bowl is positioned between the plate and the ramekin, and the robot must navigate to the bowl, grasp it, and then move it to the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move to the black bowl:** The robot needs to move forward to reach the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the black bowl:** Once the robot is close enough to the bowl, it needs to move down to grasp it.
3. **Lift the black bowl:** After grasping the bowl, the robot needs to move up to lift it.
4. **Move to the white plate:** The robot then needs to move forward again to reach the white plate.
5. **Place the black bowl on the white plate:** Finally, the robot needs to move down to place the bowl on the plate.

**Step Intervals for High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move to the black bowl:** Steps 5-18
2. **Grasp the black bowl:** Steps 26-34
3. **Lift the black bowl:** Steps 52-55
4. **Move to the white plate:** Steps 58-64
5. **Place the black bowl on the white plate:** Steps 65-65

### Plan for the Solution

**Plan:**
1. Move to the black bowl.
2. Grasp the black bowl.
3. Lift the black bowl.
4. Move to the white plate.
5. Place the black bowl on the white plate.
