### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl from the center of a table and place it on a plate. The environment contains a black bowl located at the center of the table, a white bowl also on the table, and a plate nearby. The goal is to execute a sequence of movements that will allow the robotic arm to grasp the black bowl, lift it, and place it on the designated plate while avoiding any obstacles and ensuring the stability of the bowl.

**High-Level Movements:**
Based on the task and the trajectory provided, the high-level movements that were executed can be broken down as follows:
1. **Approach the black bowl**: Move the robotic arm towards the black bowl located at the center of the table.
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: Once the arm is in position, grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the black bowl**: Lift the black bowl from the table.
4. **Move towards the plate**: Move the robotic arm with the black bowl towards the plate.
5. **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Once the arm is in position, release the black bowl onto the plate.
6. **Retract the arm**: Move the robotic arm back to a safe position.

**Intervals of High-Level Movements:**
- **Approach the black bowl**: Steps 10-14
- **Grasp the black bowl**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory (assumed to be between steps 14 and 70)
- **Lift the black bowl**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory (assumed to be between steps 14 and 70)
- **Move towards the plate**: Steps 70-72
- **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory (assumed to be after step 72)
- **Retract the arm**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory (assumed to be after step 72)

### Plan for the Solution

**Plan:**
1. **Approach the black bowl**: Move the robotic arm forward until it reaches the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: Grasp the black bowl once the arm is in position.
3. **Lift the black bowl**: Lift the black bowl from the table.
4. **Move towards the plate**: Move the robotic arm with the black bowl towards the plate.
5. **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Release the black bowl onto the plate.
6. **Retract the arm**: Move the robotic arm back to a safe position.
