### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl from the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and placing it on a white plate located on a wooden table. The environment includes several objects: a wooden table, a metal cabinet, a white plate, and a red box. The wooden cabinet is black and brown, and the table is light brown. The black bowl is stored in the top drawer of the wooden cabinet, and the white plate is on the wooden table. The task requires the robotic arm to navigate to the cabinet, open the drawer, retrieve the bowl, and then navigate to the table to place the bowl on the plate.

### High-Level Movements and Justification

Based on the executed trajectory and the task, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals:

1. **Move Forward to Reach the Cabinet (Steps 13-24)**
   - **Justification:** The robot needs to move forward to reach the wooden cabinet where the black bowl is located. This is the first necessary step to access the drawer and retrieve the bowl.

2. **Move Left to Align with the Drawer (Steps 72-90)**
   - **Justification:** After reaching the cabinet, the robot needs to move left to align itself with the top drawer. This ensures that the robotic arm can accurately open the drawer and retrieve the bowl.

3. **Move Down to Open the Drawer (Steps 90-107)**
   - **Justification:** Once aligned with the drawer, the robot needs to move down to open the drawer. This movement is necessary to access the black bowl inside the drawer.

4. **Stop (Steps 108-126)**
   - **Justification:** After opening the drawer, the robot stops to prepare for the next phase of the task, which involves retrieving the bowl and moving to the table.

### Plan for the Solution

- **High-Level Plan:**
  1. Move forward to reach the wooden cabinet.
  2. Move left to align with the top drawer.
  3. Move down to open the drawer.
  4. Retrieve the black bowl from the drawer.
  5. Move to the wooden table.
  6. Place the black bowl on the white plate.
