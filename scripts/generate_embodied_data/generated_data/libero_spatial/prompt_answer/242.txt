### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl placed next to a white plate on a table and then place the bowl on top of the plate. The environment is static, with no moving obstacles, and the bowl and plate are stationary throughout the task. The high-level movements required to complete this task include approaching the bowl, grasping the bowl, lifting the bowl, moving the bowl over the plate, and placing the bowl on the plate.

### High-Level Movements and Justification

1. **Approach the Bowl**
   - **Interval:** Steps 10-17
   - **Justification:** The robotic arm must first move forward to reach the position where the bowl is located. This is necessary to ensure that the arm is within reach of the bowl before attempting to grasp it.

2. **Grasp the Bowl**
   - **Interval:** Steps 35-36
   - **Justification:** Once the arm is in position, it must move down to grasp the bowl. This downward movement is essential to ensure that the gripper can securely grasp the bowl without knocking it over.

3. **Lift the Bowl**
   - **Interval:** Steps 65-70
   - **Justification:** After grasping the bowl, the arm must lift it to clear the table surface. This upward movement is necessary to prevent the bowl from colliding with the table or the plate while moving it.

4. **Move the Bowl Over the Plate**
   - **Interval:** Steps 73-75
   - **Justification:** With the bowl lifted, the arm must move right to position the bowl directly above the plate. This lateral movement ensures that the bowl will be placed accurately on the plate.

5. **Place the Bowl on the Plate**
   - **Interval:** Steps 86-91
   - **Justification:** Finally, the arm must move down to place the bowl on the plate. This downward movement is required to release the bowl onto the plate, completing the task.
