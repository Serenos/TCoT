### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl from a wooden cabinet and place it on a plate located on a wooden table. The robotic arm starts at an initial position and must navigate to the bowl, grasp it, and then move to the plate to place the bowl down.

#### High-Level Movements and Justifications

1. **Move Down to Approach the Cabinet** (Steps 33-34)
   - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to lower itself to reach the height of the wooden cabinet where the black bowl is located.
   
2. **Move Left to Align with the Bowl** (Steps 61-87)
   - **Justification**: After reaching the appropriate height, the robotic arm needs to move horizontally to align with the position of the black bowl on the cabinet.
   
3. **Move Left Down to Reach the Bowl** (Steps 88-93)
   - **Justification**: Once aligned horizontally, the robotic arm needs to move diagonally downward to precisely reach the bowl and prepare for grasping it.
   
4. **Move Down to Grasp the Bowl** (Steps 94-108)
   - **Justification**: After reaching the bowl, the robotic arm needs to move vertically downward to grasp the bowl securely.
   
5. **Stop to Stabilize the Grasp** (Steps 109-134)
   - **Justification**: After grasping the bowl, the robotic arm needs to pause to ensure a stable grip before moving the bowl to the plate.
