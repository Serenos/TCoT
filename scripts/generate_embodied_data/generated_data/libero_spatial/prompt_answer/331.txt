### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The robotic arm's task is to pick up a black bowl located on a cookie box and place it on a plate. Both the cookie box and the plate are on the table. The robot must navigate to the bowl, grasp it, lift it, navigate to the plate, and then place the bowl on the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Navigate to the Bowl:** The robot moves forward to reach the position where the black bowl is located on the cookie box.
   - Steps: 6-23
2. **Lower Arm to Grasp the Bowl:** Once at the bowl, the robot lowers its arm to grasp the bowl.
   - Steps: 24-35
3. **Lift the Bowl:** After grasping the bowl, the robot lifts it up.
   - Steps: 52-56
4. **Navigate to the Plate:** The robot then moves to the location of the plate.
   - Steps: 65-70
5. **Lower Arm to Place the Bowl:** Finally, the robot lowers its arm to place the bowl on the plate.
   - Steps: 71-76

### High-Level Plan Justification

**Plan:**
- **Navigate to the Bowl:** The robot must first move to the bowl to grasp it.
- **Grasp the Bowl:** Once at the bowl, the robot must lower its arm to grasp the bowl.
- **Lift the Bowl:** After grasping the bowl, the robot must lift it to prepare for moving it to the plate.
- **Navigate to the Plate:** The robot must then move to the plate to place the bowl.
- **Place the Bowl:** Finally, the robot must lower its arm to place the bowl on the plate.
