### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task

The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl located in the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and place it on a plate. The environment contains a wooden cabinet with a drawer, a table with three bowls and a round plate. The goal is to navigate the robotic arm to the drawer, open it, retrieve the black bowl, and then move the bowl to the plate on the table.

#### High-Level Movements

Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features`, the high-level movements executed by the robotic arm can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the Cabinet**: The robot moves forward to reach the wooden cabinet.
   - Steps: 5-16
2. **Lift the Arm to Reach the Drawer Handle**: Once at the cabinet, the robot lifts its arm to reach the handle of the top drawer.
   - Steps: 61-70
3. **Move Left to Align with the Drawer Handle**: After lifting the arm, the robot moves left to align with the drawer handle.
   - Steps: 75-84
4. **Lower the Arm to Grasp the Drawer Handle**: The robot lowers its arm to grasp the drawer handle.
   - Steps: 97-101
5. **Open the Drawer and Retrieve the Black Bowl**: The robot opens the drawer, retrieves the black bowl, and closes the drawer.
   - Note: This part is not explicitly shown in the trajectory but is implied by the context.
6. **Move to the Plate**: The robot moves to the plate on the table.
   - Note: This part is not explicitly shown in the trajectory but is implied by the context.
7. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate**: The robot places the black bowl on the plate.
   - Note: This part is not explicitly shown in the trajectory but is implied by the context.

#### Plan for the Solution

The high-level plan for completing the task is as follows:
1. Move forward to approach the wooden cabinet.
2. Lift the arm to reach the drawer handle.
3. Move left to align with the drawer handle.
4. Lower the arm to grasp the drawer handle.
5. Open the drawer and retrieve the black bowl.
6. Move to the plate.
7. Place the black bowl on the plate.
