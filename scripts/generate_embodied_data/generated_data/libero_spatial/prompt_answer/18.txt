### Task Description

**Task Overview:**
The task is to pick up a black bowl from a cookie box and place it on a plate. The black bowl is initially located on top of a cookie box, which is placed on a table. The plate is also on the table, but at a different location.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move towards the black bowl:** The robotic arm needs to navigate to the location of the black bowl on the cookie box.
2. **Pick up the black bowl:** Once the arm is in position, it needs to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Move towards the plate:** After picking up the bowl, the arm needs to navigate to the location of the plate.
4. **Place the black bowl on the plate:** Finally, the arm should release the bowl onto the plate.

**Intervals of High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move towards the black bowl:** Steps 6-26
2. **Pick up the black bowl:** Steps 27-34
3. **Move towards the plate:** Steps 59-72
4. **Place the black bowl on the plate:** Steps 73-80

### Plan for the Solution

**Plan:**
1. Move the robotic arm towards the black bowl on the cookie box.
2. Pick up the black bowl.
3. Move the robotic arm towards the plate.
4. Place the black bowl on the plate.
