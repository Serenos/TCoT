### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl from a cookie box and place it on a plate. The black bowl is initially placed on top of the cookie box, which is on the table. The plate is also on the table, at a different location. The goal is to execute a sequence of actions that will allow the robotic arm to successfully complete this task.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the executed trajectory and the task, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Move to the black bowl**: The robotic arm needs to navigate to the position of the black bowl on the cookie box.
   - Steps: 6-22
2. **Lower the arm to grasp the black bowl**: Once the arm is positioned above the black bowl, it needs to lower itself to grasp the bowl.
   - Steps: 32-40
3. **Lift the black bowl**: After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to lift it up.
   - Steps: 60-64
4. **Move to the plate**: The arm then needs to navigate to the position of the plate.
   - Steps: 81-86
5. **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Finally, the arm needs to lower itself to place the bowl on the plate.
   - Steps: 81-86

#### Plan for Solution
The plan for completing the task involves the following high-level steps:
1. Move the robotic arm to the black bowl.
2. Lower the arm to grasp the black bowl.
3. Lift the black bowl.
4. Move the robotic arm to the plate.
5. Lower the arm to place the black bowl on the plate.
