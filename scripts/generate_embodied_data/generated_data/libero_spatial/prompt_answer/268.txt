### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl located next to a ramekin and place it on a nearby plate. The environment contains the following objects:
- **Black Bowl**: Located next to the ramekin.
- **Ramekin**: A small dish, positioned near the black bowl.
- **Plate**: A flat surface where the black bowl should be placed.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals:
1. **Move Left to Reach the Black Bowl** (Steps 5-27)
2. **Move Down to Reach the Black Bowl** (Steps 30-45)
3. **Move Forward to Pick Up the Black Bowl** (Steps 69-83)
4. **Move Down to Place the Black Bowl on the Plate** (Steps 90-91)

#### Justification for High-Level Movements
1. **Move Left to Reach the Black Bowl**
   - **Reason**: The black bowl is initially to the left of the robot's starting position. To reach it, the robot must move left.
   - **Interval**: Steps 5-27

2. **Move Down to Reach the Black Bowl**
   - **Reason**: After moving left, the robot needs to move down to align its gripper with the black bowl.
   - **Interval**: Steps 30-45

3. **Move Forward to Pick Up the Black Bowl**
   - **Reason**: Once aligned, the robot needs to move forward to grasp the black bowl.
   - **Interval**: Steps 69-83

4. **Move Down to Place the Black Bowl on the Plate**
   - **Reason**: After picking up the black bowl, the robot needs to move down to place it on the plate.
   - **Interval**: Steps 90-91
