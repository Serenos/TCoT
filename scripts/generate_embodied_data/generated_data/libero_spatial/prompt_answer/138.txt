### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task is to control a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl that is located next to a ramekin and place it on a nearby plate. The environment consists of a black bowl, a ramekin, and a plate. The black bowl is the object to be manipulated, and the plate is the target location.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move to the black bowl:** The robotic arm needs to position itself above the black bowl.
2. **Pick up the black bowl:** The robotic arm needs to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Move to the plate:** The robotic arm needs to lift the black bowl and position itself above the plate.
4. **Place the black bowl on the plate:** The robotic arm needs to release the black bowl onto the plate.

**Step Intervals for High-Level Movements:**
- **Move to the black bowl:** Steps 0-28
- **Pick up the black bowl:** Steps 29-59
- **Move to the plate:** Steps 60-119
- **Place the black bowl on the plate:** Steps 120-144

### Justification for High-Level Movements

1. **Move to the black bowl:**
   - **Justification:** The robotic arm must first position itself above the black bowl to prepare for picking it up. This involves moving horizontally (left) to align with the bowl's position.
   
2. **Pick up the black bowl:**
   - **Justification:** Once the arm is positioned above the black bowl, it needs to move vertically (down) to grasp the bowl. After grasping, it should stop to ensure a secure hold.

3. **Move to the plate:**
   - **Justification:** With the black bowl securely in its grasp, the robotic arm needs to lift the bowl and move it to the plate. This involves moving vertically (up) and then horizontally (forward) to align with the plate's position.

4. **Place the black bowl on the plate:**
   - **Justification:** Once the arm is positioned above the plate, it needs to move vertically (down) to place the black bowl on the plate. After placing, it should stop to ensure the bowl is securely placed.
