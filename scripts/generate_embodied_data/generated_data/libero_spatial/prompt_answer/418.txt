### Task Overview

The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl located between a white plate and a red and white striped ramekin on a wooden table and then place it on the white plate. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the white plate.

### High-Level Movements and Justification

Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the Black Bowl** (Steps 6-14): The robotic arm moves forward to reach the position where the black bowl is located.
2. **Lower Arm to Grasp the Bowl** (Steps 15-33): The arm moves downward to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the Bowl** (Steps 52-54): The arm moves upward to lift the bowl off the table.
4. **Stop and Maintain Position** (Steps 0-5, 34-51, 55-87): The arm stops at various points to ensure stability and to prepare for the next movement.

### Plan for the Solution

The high-level plan for completing the task is as follows:
1. **Approach the Black Bowl**: Move the arm forward to reach the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the Black Bowl**: Lower the arm to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl**: Lift the arm to raise the black bowl off the table.
4. **Move to the White Plate**: Navigate to the white plate.
5. **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate**: Lower the arm to place the black bowl on the white plate.
