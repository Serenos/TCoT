### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task is to control a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl located next to a cookie box and place it on a white plate. The environment consists of a table where the black bowl, the cookie box, and the white plate are placed. The robotic arm starts at an initial position and must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then navigate to the white plate to place the bowl down.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the executed trajectory and the task description, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Navigate to the Black Bowl**: The robotic arm moves forward to reach the black bowl.
2. **Stop and Prepare to Pick Up the Bowl**: The arm stops near the bowl to prepare for grasping.
3. **Lift the Arm to Pick Up the Bowl**: The arm moves upward to lift the bowl off the table.
4. **Navigate to the White Plate**: The arm moves forward again to reach the white plate.
5. **Place the Bowl on the White Plate**: The arm lowers the bowl onto the plate.
6. **Stop**: The arm stops after placing the bowl.

#### Intervals and Justifications
- **Navigate to the Black Bowl**: Steps 9-28
  - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to move forward to reach the black bowl, which is located next to the cookie box.
- **Stop and Prepare to Pick Up the Bowl**: Steps 29-65
  - **Justification**: The arm stops to ensure it is in the correct position to grasp the bowl without knocking over the cookie box or other objects.
- **Lift the Arm to Pick Up the Bowl**: Steps 66-72
  - **Justification**: The arm moves upward to lift the bowl off the table, ensuring it does not collide with any objects on the table.
- **Navigate to the White Plate**: Steps 73-119
  - **Justification**: The arm moves forward to reach the white plate, where it will place the bowl.
