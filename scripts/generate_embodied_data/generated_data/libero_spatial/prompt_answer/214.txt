### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
- **Activity:** The robotic arm is tasked with picking up a black bowl that is placed on a cookie box and then placing the bowl on a plate.
- **Objects Involved:**
  - **Black Bowl:** Initially located on top of the cookie box.
  - **Cookie Box:** Placed on the table.
  - **Plate:** Also placed on the table, at a different location from the cookie box.
- **Relative Locations:**
  - The black bowl is on the cookie box.
  - The cookie box and the plate are both on the table, but they are at different positions.
- **High-Level Movements:**
  1. **Move to the Cookie Box:** The robotic arm needs to move towards the cookie box where the black bowl is located.
  2. **Lift the Black Bowl:** Once the arm is close enough to the cookie box, it needs to lift the black bowl.
  3. **Move to the Plate:** After lifting the bowl, the arm needs to move towards the plate.
  4. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate:** Finally, the arm places the black bowl on the plate.

**Plan for the Solution:**
- **Move to the Cookie Box:** The arm starts by moving forward to reach the cookie box.
- **Lift the Black Bowl:** Once the arm is in position, it moves up to avoid hitting the table and then moves down to grasp the black bowl.
- **Move to the Plate:** After lifting the bowl, the arm moves forward again to reach the plate.
- **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate:** Finally, the arm moves down to place the bowl on the plate.

### High-Level Movements and Intervals

1. **Move to the Cookie Box:** Steps 7-26
2. **Lift the Black Bowl:** Steps 64-91
3. **Move to the Plate:** Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied by the context.
4. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate:** Steps 87-91
