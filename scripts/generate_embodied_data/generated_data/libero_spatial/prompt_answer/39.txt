### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task is to pick up a black bowl located between a white plate and a red and white striped ramekin on a light wooden table and place it on the white plate. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the white plate.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the black bowl**: Move the arm forward to reach the black bowl.
   - Steps: 8-18
   - Justification: The black bowl is located in front of the robot, so moving forward is necessary to reach it.

2. **Lower the arm to grasp the black bowl**: Move the arm downward to grasp the black bowl.
   - Steps: 19-36
   - Justification: The black bowl is on the table, so lowering the arm is necessary to reach it and grasp it.

3. **Lift the black bowl**: Move the arm upward to lift the black bowl.
   - Steps: 37-54
   - Justification: After grasping the black bowl, lifting it is necessary to clear the table and prepare for the next movement.

4. **Move to the white plate**: Move the arm forward to reach the white plate.
   - Steps: 65-70
   - Justification: The white plate is located in front of the robot, so moving forward is necessary to reach it.

5. **Lower the arm to place the black bowl on the white plate**: Move the arm downward to place the black bowl on the white plate.
   - Steps: 71-74
   - Justification: The white plate is on the table, so lowering the arm is necessary to place the black bowl on it.

6. **Lift the arm**: Move the arm upward to clear the white plate.
   - Steps: 98
   - Justification: Lifting the arm is necessary to clear the white plate and complete the task.
