### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm operating in an environment where a black bowl is placed next to a white plate on a table. The goal is to pick up the black bowl and place it on the white plate. This task requires the robotic arm to perform a series of precise movements to achieve the desired outcome.

### High-Level Movements and Plan

Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features`, the high-level movements executed by the robotic arm can be broken down as follows:

1. **Initial Positioning**: The robotic arm starts in a neutral position, possibly above the table or at a safe distance from the objects.
2. **Approach the Bowl**: The robotic arm moves downward to reach the height of the black bowl.
3. **Lift the Bowl**: Once the arm is at the correct height, it lifts the black bowl.
4. **Move to the Plate**: The robotic arm then moves upward to clear the table surface and positions itself above the white plate.
5. **Place the Bowl**: Finally, the arm lowers the black bowl onto the white plate.

#### High-Level Plan
- **Approach the Bowl**: Move the arm downward to reach the black bowl.
- **Lift the Bowl**: Pick up the black bowl.
- **Move to the Plate**: Move the arm upward to clear the table and position it above the white plate.
- **Place the Bowl**: Lower the black bowl onto the white plate.
