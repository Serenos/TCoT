### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl located between a white plate and a red and white striped ramekin and placing it on the white plate. The objects are situated on a wooden table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, move it over to the white plate, and release it onto the plate.

### High-Level Movements and Justifications

Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features`, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Navigate to the Black Bowl**
   - **Steps**: 12-23
   - **Justification**: The robot needs to move forward to reach the black bowl, which is located between the plate and the ramekin. This is necessary to position the arm close enough to the bowl to pick it up.

2. **Lower Arm to Grasp the Black Bowl**
   - **Steps**: 31-41
   - **Justification**: After reaching the bowl, the robot must lower its arm to grasp the bowl. This is essential to ensure that the gripper is positioned correctly to pick up the bowl without knocking over the ramekin or the plate.

3. **Lift the Black Bowl**
   - **Steps**: 66-68
   - **Justification**: Once the bowl is grasped, the robot must lift it to clear the table surface. This is necessary to prevent the bowl from colliding with other objects during the transfer.

4. **Move the Black Bowl Over the White Plate**
   - **Steps**: 84-85
   - **Justification**: After lifting the bowl, the robot needs to move it over the white plate. This ensures that the bowl is positioned correctly for placement.

5. **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate**
   - **Steps**: 84-85 (continued)
   - **Justification**: The final step is to lower the bowl onto the white plate. This completes the task of moving the bowl from its initial position to the desired location.
