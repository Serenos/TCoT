### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm performing a specific manipulation in a structured environment. The goal is to **pick up a black bowl located between a white plate and a red and white striped ramekin and place it on the white plate**. The objects are situated on a wooden table, and the robotic arm must navigate around them to achieve the task.

#### High-Level Movements and Justifications

Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Move to the black bowl**: The robotic arm needs to position itself above the black bowl to prepare for picking it up.
   - **Steps**: 10-15
   - **Justification**: The arm must move forward to reach the location of the black bowl, which is initially out of reach.

2. **Lower the arm to grasp the black bowl**: Once positioned above the bowl, the arm must lower itself to grasp the bowl.
   - **Steps**: 19-35
   - **Justification**: Lowering the arm is necessary to bring the gripper close enough to the bowl to securely grasp it.

3. **Lift the black bowl**: After grasping the bowl, the arm must lift it to clear the table surface.
   - **Steps**: 49-54
   - **Justification**: Lifting the bowl is essential to prevent it from colliding with the table or other objects while moving it.

4. **Move to the white plate**: The arm must then reposition itself above the white plate to place the bowl.
   - **Steps**: 64-71
   - **Justification**: Moving forward again is necessary to align the bowl with the target location, the white plate.

5. **Lower the arm to place the black bowl on the white plate**: The arm must lower itself to place the bowl on the plate.
   - **Steps**: 126-144
   - **Justification**: Lowering the arm ensures the bowl is gently placed on the plate without dropping it.

6. **Lift the arm to clear the table**: Finally, the arm must lift itself to clear the table and return to a neutral position.
   - **Steps**: 145-148
   - **Justification**: Lifting the arm is necessary to avoid any potential collisions and to signal the completion of the task.
