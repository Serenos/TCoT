### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl located next to a ramekin and place it on a nearby plate. The environment is structured such that the black bowl is positioned to the left and slightly below the ramekin, while the plate is located forward and slightly above the initial position of the robotic arm.

#### High-Level Movements and Justification

Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Move Left to Reach the Black Bowl** (Steps 7-24)
   - **Justification**: The black bowl is to the left of the initial position of the robotic arm. Moving left is necessary to align the arm with the bowl.

2. **Move Down to Grasp the Black Bowl** (Steps 41-52)
   - **Justification**: After reaching the horizontal position of the black bowl, the arm needs to move downward to grasp the bowl.

3. **Move Up to Lift the Black Bowl** (Steps 81-84)
   - **Justification**: Once the bowl is grasped, the arm needs to move upward to lift the bowl off the surface.

4. **Move Forward to Reach the Plate** (Steps 87-94)
   - **Justification**: With the bowl lifted, the arm needs to move forward to reach the plate where the bowl will be placed.

5. **Move Down to Place the Black Bowl on the Plate** (Steps 99-105)
   - **Justification**: Finally, the arm needs to move downward to place the bowl on the plate.
