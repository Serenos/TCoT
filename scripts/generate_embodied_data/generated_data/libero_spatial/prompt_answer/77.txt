### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task is to **pick up the black bowl next to the cookie box and place it on the plate**. The environment consists of a table where a silver bowl, a black bowl, a cookie box, and a white plate are placed. The black bowl is located next to the cookie box, and the white plate is on the table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, and then move it to the white plate.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Move to the black bowl**: The robot needs to move forward to reach the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: Once the robot is close enough, it needs to move down to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the black bowl**: After grasping the black bowl, the robot needs to lift it.
4. **Move to the white plate**: The robot needs to move left to reach the white plate.
5. **Place the black bowl on the white plate**: Finally, the robot needs to lower the black bowl onto the white plate.

#### Intervals of High-Level Movements
- **Move to the black bowl**: Steps 3-25
- **Grasp the black bowl**: Steps 37-44
- **Lift the black bowl**: Steps 61-65
- **Move to the white plate**: Steps 81-84
- **Place the black bowl on the white plate**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied by the context.
