### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
- **Activity:** The robotic arm is tasked with picking up a black bowl from the stove and placing it on a plate.
- **Objects Involved:**
  - **Black Bowl:** Initially on the stove.
  - **Stove:** Located next to the wooden table.
  - **Plate:** On the wooden table.
  - **Wooden Table:** Next to the stove.
- **Relative Locations:**
  - The black bowl is on the stove.
  - The plate is on the wooden table.
  - The stove is next to the wooden table.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move to the Stove:**
   - Steps: 0-10
   - Justification: The robotic arm needs to position itself above the black bowl on the stove.
2. **Move Down to Pick Up the Black Bowl:**
   - Steps: 11-22
   - Justification: The arm needs to lower itself to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Move Back Up:**
   - Steps: 23-50
   - Justification: The arm needs to lift the black bowl off the stove.
4. **Move to the Plate:**
   - Steps: 51-100
   - Justification: The arm needs to position itself above the plate on the wooden table.
5. **Move Down to Place the Black Bowl:**
   - Steps: 101-104
   - Justification: The arm needs to lower itself to place the black bowl on the plate.
6. **Move Back Up:**
   - Steps: 105-141
   - Justification: The arm needs to lift itself away from the plate after placing the black bowl.

**Plan for the Solution:**
1. Move to the stove.
2. Move down to pick up the black bowl.
3. Move back up with the black bowl.
4. Move to the plate.
5. Move down to place the black bowl on the plate.
6. Move back up after placing the black bowl.
