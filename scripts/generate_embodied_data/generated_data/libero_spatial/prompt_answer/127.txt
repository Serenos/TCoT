### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task is to pick up a black bowl that is initially placed on a ramekin and then place it on a plate. The robotic arm must navigate through the environment, identify the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, and finally place it on the plate. The environment consists of the following objects and their relative positions:
- A black bowl on a ramekin.
- The ramekin is on a plate.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Approach the ramekin**: The robotic arm moves towards the ramekin where the black bowl is located.
2. **Lower the arm to grasp the bowl**: The robotic arm moves downwards to reach the height of the bowl.
3. **Grasp the bowl**: The robotic arm grasps the black bowl.
4. **Lift the bowl**: The robotic arm lifts the bowl off the ramekin.
5. **Move to the plate**: The robotic arm moves horizontally to position itself over the plate.
6. **Place the bowl on the plate**: The robotic arm lowers the bowl and places it on the plate.

#### Intervals and Justifications
- **Approach the ramekin**: Steps 0-59
  - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to move towards the ramekin to reach the black bowl.
- **Lower the arm to grasp the bowl**: Steps 60-86
  - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to move downwards to reach the height of the bowl.
- **Grasp the bowl**: Steps 87-105
  - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to grasp the bowl to pick it up.
- **Lift the bowl**: Steps 87-105 (same as grasping, but with lifting)
  - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to lift the bowl off the ramekin.
- **Move to the plate**: Steps 60-86 (same as lowering, but with horizontal movement)
  - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to move horizontally to position itself over the plate.
- **Place the bowl on the plate**: Steps 87-105 (same as grasping, but with placing)
  - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to lower the bowl and place it on the plate.
