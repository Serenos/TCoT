### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl from a ramekin and place it on a white plate. The environment includes a silver bowl on a ramekin, a white plate on the table, and the black bowl that is the target object. The robotic arm must navigate through this environment, grasp the black bowl, and place it on the white plate.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features` dictionary, the high-level movements that were executed are as follows:
1. **Initial Positioning**: The robotic arm starts in a neutral position and does not move for several steps, likely to ensure stability and prepare for the task.
2. **Approach the Ramekin**: The robotic arm moves downward to approach the ramekin where the black bowl is located.
3. **Move Forward to Grasp the Bowl**: After reaching the appropriate height, the robotic arm moves forward to reach the black bowl and grasp it.
4. **Lift the Bowl**: The robotic arm lifts the bowl from the ramekin.
5. **Move to the Plate**: The robotic arm moves forward to reach the white plate.
6. **Place the Bowl on the Plate**: The robotic arm places the black bowl on the white plate.
7. **Retract**: The robotic arm moves back to a neutral position.

#### Intervals and Justifications
- **Initial Positioning**: Steps 0-20
  - **Justification**: The robotic arm remains stationary to ensure it is in a stable and ready position before starting the task.
- **Approach the Ramekin**: Steps 21-29
  - **Justification**: The robotic arm moves downward to reach the height of the ramekin where the black bowl is located.
- **Move Forward to Grasp the Bowl**: Steps 74-84
  - **Justification**: The robotic arm moves forward to reach the black bowl and grasp it.
- **Lift the Bowl**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied between steps 84 and 85.
  - **Justification**: After grasping the bowl, the robotic arm lifts it to prepare for moving it to the plate.
- **Move to the Plate**: Steps 74-84 (repeated)
  - **Justification**: The robotic arm moves forward again to reach the white plate.
- **Place the Bowl on the Plate**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied after step 84.
  - **Justification**: The robotic arm places the black bowl on the white plate.
- **Retract**: Steps 85-111
  - **Justification**: The robotic arm moves back to a neutral position to complete the task.
