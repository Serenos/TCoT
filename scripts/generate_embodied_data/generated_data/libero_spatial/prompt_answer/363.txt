### Task Overview

The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl that is located next to a cookie box and place it on a plate. The environment consists of a table where the black bowl, the cookie box, and the plate are situated. The black bowl is the target object, and the plate is the destination. The cookie box is a landmark that helps in locating the black bowl. The high-level movements executed by the robotic arm to complete this task include moving towards the black bowl, lifting the arm to avoid obstacles, moving horizontally to align with the bowl, and then performing the pick-and-place operation.

### High-Level Movements and Justifications

1. **Move Forward to Approach the Black Bowl**
   - **Interval**: Steps 7 to 27
   - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to move forward to reach the black bowl, which is located next to the cookie box. Moving forward is necessary to reduce the distance between the arm and the bowl.

2. **Stop to Assess the Position**
   - **Interval**: Steps 28 to 59
   - **Justification**: After approaching the black bowl, the arm stops to assess its position relative to the bowl. This pause allows the system to verify the exact location of the bowl and plan the next movements accurately.

3. **Move Up to Lift the Arm**
   - **Interval**: Steps 60 to 63
   - **Justification**: To avoid any potential obstacles and to prepare for grasping the bowl, the arm moves upwards. This vertical movement ensures that the arm is in a suitable position to grasp the bowl without colliding with other objects.

4. **Move Left to Align with the Black Bowl**
   - **Interval**: Steps 74 to 83
   - **Justification**: After lifting the arm, the robotic arm moves left to align itself with the black bowl. This horizontal movement is necessary to position the gripper directly above the bowl, ensuring a precise grasp.

5. **Stop to Prepare for Grasping**
   - **Interval**: Steps 84 to 107
   - **Justification**: Once aligned with the black bowl, the arm stops to prepare for grasping the bowl. This pause allows the system to fine-tune the gripper's position and ensure a secure grasp before executing the pick-and-place operation.
