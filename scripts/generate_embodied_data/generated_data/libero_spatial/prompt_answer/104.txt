### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl from the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and placing it on a plate. The environment includes a white paper plate, a red and white paper plate, a small tin can, a dark brown wooden cabinet, and a grey wall. The robotic arm must navigate through the environment, open the top drawer of the wooden cabinet, retrieve the black bowl, and then place it on one of the plates.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move to the Wooden Cabinet:** The robotic arm needs to move towards the wooden cabinet to access the top drawer.
2. **Open the Top Drawer:** Once at the cabinet, the robotic arm must open the top drawer to reach the black bowl.
3. **Pick Up the Black Bowl:** After opening the drawer, the robotic arm must grasp the black bowl.
4. **Move to the Plate:** The robotic arm must then move to the location of the plate where the black bowl will be placed.
5. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate:** Finally, the robotic arm must release the black bowl onto the plate.

**Intervals and Justifications:**
1. **Move to the Wooden Cabinet (Steps 7-21):**
   - **Justification:** The robotic arm needs to move forward to reach the wooden cabinet, which is initially out of its reach.
2. **Open the Top Drawer (Steps 64-105):**
   - **Justification:** After reaching the cabinet, the robotic arm needs to move up to align with the top drawer, then move left to reach the handle, and finally move down to open the drawer.
3. **Pick Up the Black Bowl (Steps 106-146):**
   - **Justification:** Once the drawer is open, the robotic arm needs to move down to grasp the black bowl and then stop to ensure a secure grip before moving it.
