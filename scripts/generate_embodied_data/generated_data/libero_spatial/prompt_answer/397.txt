### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
- **Objective:** The robotic arm is tasked with picking up a black bowl from a cookie box and placing it on a plate, both of which are located on a table.
- **Objects Involved:**
  - **Black Bowl:** Initially placed on top of the cookie box.
  - **Cookie Box:** Positioned on the table.
  - **Plate:** Also positioned on the table, at a different location from the cookie box.
- **Environment:**
  - The table is the primary surface where all objects are located.
  - The robotic arm starts at an initial position, which is not specified but is assumed to be far from the cookie box and the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Approach the Cookie Box:**
   - Steps: 6-25
   - Justification: The robotic arm needs to move towards the cookie box to reach the black bowl.
2. **Move Down to Reach the Black Bowl:**
   - Steps: 28-43
   - Justification: Once the arm is near the cookie box, it needs to move downward to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl:**
   - Steps: 61-64
   - Justification: After grasping the black bowl, the arm needs to lift it to prepare for moving it to the plate.
4. **Move to the Plate:**
   - Steps: 81-82
   - Justification: With the black bowl lifted, the arm needs to move towards the plate to place it.
5. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate:**
   - Steps: 81-82
   - Justification: Once the arm is above the plate, it needs to move downward to place the black bowl on the plate.

### High-Level Plan

- **Plan:**
  - Approach the cookie box.
  - Move down to reach the black bowl.
  - Lift the black bowl.
  - Move to the plate.
  - Place the black bowl on the plate.
