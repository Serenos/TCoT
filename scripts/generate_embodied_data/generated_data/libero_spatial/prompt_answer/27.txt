### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl from a ramekin and place it on a plate. The environment consists of a table where a ramekin is placed on a plate, and the black bowl is initially on the ramekin. The goal is to move the black bowl from the ramekin to the plate, ensuring that the bowl is securely grasped and carefully placed to avoid dropping or damaging it.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Move to the Ramekin**: The robot needs to position its arm above the ramekin to reach the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the Bowl**: Once above the bowl, the robot needs to lower its arm to grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the Bowl**: After grasping the bowl, the robot needs to lift it off the ramekin.
4. **Move to the Plate**: The robot then needs to move the bowl to the plate.
5. **Place the Bowl**: Finally, the robot needs to lower the bowl onto the plate and release it.

#### Intervals and Justifications for High-Level Movements

1. **Move to the Ramekin** (Steps 9-10)
   - **Justification**: The robot needs to position itself above the ramekin to be able to grasp the black bowl. The initial movements to the left are necessary to align the arm with the ramekin's position.

2. **Grasp the Bowl** (Steps 16-25)
   - **Justification**: Once the arm is aligned with the ramekin, the robot needs to move downward to reach the bowl. Multiple downward movements are required to ensure the arm is precisely positioned to grasp the bowl.

3. **Lift the Bowl** (Steps 53-62)
   - **Justification**: After grasping the bowl, the robot needs to lift it off the ramekin. Moving forward and slightly downward ensures the bowl is lifted without tilting or dropping.

4. **Move to the Plate** (Steps 63-71)
   - **Justification**: With the bowl grasped, the robot needs to move it to the plate. This involves moving forward and downward to position the bowl above the plate.

5. **Place the Bowl** (Steps 72-85)
   - **Justification**: The final step is to place the bowl on the plate. The robot needs to stop and ensure the bowl is securely placed before releasing it.
