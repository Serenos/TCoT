### Task Overview

The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl located next to a ramekin and place it on a plate where a silver bowl already resides. The environment contains the following objects and their relative positions:
- **Silver Bowl**: On the plate.
- **Black Bowl**: Next to the ramekin.
- **Ramekin**: On the table.
- **Stack of Drawers**: On the table.

### High-Level Movements and Plan

Based on the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals:

1. **Move Left (Steps 5-25)**: The robotic arm moves left to align itself with the black bowl.
2. **Move Down (Steps 36-41)**: The robotic arm moves down to reach the height of the black bowl.
3. **Move Forward (Steps 75-88)**: The robotic arm moves forward to grasp the black bowl.
4. **Move to Plate (Not Explicitly Shown in Trajectory)**: After grasping the black bowl, the robotic arm would move to the plate to place the bowl.
5. **Release Black Bowl (Not Explicitly Shown in Trajectory)**: The robotic arm releases the black bowl onto the plate.

### Plan for Solution

The plan for completing the task is as follows:
1. **Align with the Black Bowl**: Move the robotic arm to the left until it is aligned with the black bowl.
2. **Reach the Black Bowl**: Move the robotic arm down to the height of the black bowl.
3. **Grasp the Black Bowl**: Move the robotic arm forward to grasp the black bowl.
4. **Move to the Plate**: Move the robotic arm to the plate.
5. **Place the Black Bowl**: Release the black bowl onto the plate.
