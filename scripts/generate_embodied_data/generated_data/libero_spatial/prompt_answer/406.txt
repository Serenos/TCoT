### Task Overview

The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl from the stove and place it on a plate located on a wooden table. The environment consists of a stove, where a black bowl is placed, and a wooden table, where a plate is situated. The stove is positioned next to the table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, and then move to the plate to place the bowl on it.

### High-Level Movements and Plan

Based on the executed trajectory, the high-level movements and the corresponding intervals are as follows:

1. **Approach the black bowl on the stove** (Steps 0-8): The robot initially stops, likely assessing its surroundings or waiting for a command.
2. **Move down to reach the black bowl** (Steps 9-16): The robot moves downward to reach the black bowl on the stove.
3. **Grasp the black bowl** (Steps 17-26): The robot stops, likely to ensure it has a secure grip on the black bowl.
4. **Lift the black bowl** (Steps 27-46): The robot continues to stop, possibly to lift the bowl and ensure it is securely held.
5. **Move to the plate on the table** (Steps 47-131): The robot stops, likely moving towards the plate on the table while ensuring the bowl is stable.
