### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
- **Activity:** The robotic arm's task is to pick up a black bowl located on a wooden cabinet and place it on a white plate situated on a wooden table.
- **Objects Involved:**
  - **Black Bowl:** Initially placed on the wooden cabinet.
  - **White Plate:** Located on the wooden table.
  - **Robotic Arm:** The agent responsible for executing the task.
- **Relative Locations:**
  - The wooden cabinet is positioned higher than the wooden table.
  - The black bowl is initially on the wooden cabinet.
  - The white plate is on the wooden table, at a lower height than the cabinet.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move Down to Reach the Black Bowl:** The robotic arm needs to lower itself to reach the black bowl on the wooden cabinet.
2. **Move Up to Lift the Black Bowl:** Once the bowl is grasped, the arm must lift it.
3. **Move Left to Align with the White Plate:** The arm needs to move horizontally to align with the position of the white plate on the wooden table.
4. **Move Down to Place the Black Bowl:** Finally, the arm must lower itself to place the black bowl on the white plate.

**High-Level Plan:**
- **Step 1:** Move down to reach the black bowl on the wooden cabinet.
- **Step 2:** Move up to lift the black bowl.
- **Step 3:** Move left to align with the white plate on the wooden table.
- **Step 4:** Move down to place the black bowl on the white plate.

**Intervals for High-Level Movements:**
- **Move Down to Reach the Black Bowl:** Steps 41-43
- **Move Up to Lift the Black Bowl:** Steps 60-66
- **Move Left to Align with the White Plate:** Steps 67-94
- **Move Down to Place the Black Bowl:** Steps 95-111
