### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl from a ramekin and placing it on a plate. The environment consists of a black bowl placed on a ramekin, which is itself on a plate. The goal is to move the black bowl from the ramekin to the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Initial Positioning:** The robot arm moves to a position above the black bowl on the ramekin.
2. **Picking Up the Bowl:** The robot arm grasps the black bowl.
3. **Lifting the Bowl:** The robot arm lifts the black bowl off the ramekin.
4. **Moving to the Plate:** The robot arm moves horizontally to position the black bowl over the plate.
5. **Placing the Bowl:** The robot arm releases the black bowl onto the plate.

**Step Intervals and Justifications:**
- **Initial Positioning (Steps 61-62):** The robot arm moves up slightly and then stops, likely to prepare for the next movement.
- **Moving to the Ramekin (Steps 66-85):** The robot arm moves forward multiple times to reach the position above the black bowl on the ramekin.
- **Picking Up the Bowl (Steps 86-108):** The robot arm stops, likely to grasp the black bowl. This part of the trajectory is not explicitly shown in the provided movements, but it is implied by the subsequent lifting and moving actions.
- **Lifting the Bowl (Steps 86-108):** The robot arm continues to stop, which might indicate the lifting process or a brief pause before moving.
- **Moving to the Plate (Steps 86-108):** The robot arm stops, likely to prepare for the final movement to the plate.
- **Placing the Bowl (Steps 86-108):** The robot arm stops, indicating the placement of the bowl on the plate.
