### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The robotic arm is tasked with picking up a black bowl from a wooden cabinet and placing it on a plate located on a wooden table. The environment consists of the robotic arm, the black bowl on the wooden cabinet, and the plate on the wooden table. The task involves navigating the arm to the bowl, grasping it, moving it to the plate, and releasing it.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Approach the Bowl:** The robotic arm must move towards the location of the black bowl on the wooden cabinet.
2. **Grasp the Bowl:** Once in position, the robotic arm must grasp the black bowl.
3. **Move to the Plate:** After grasping the bowl, the robotic arm must navigate to the location of the plate on the wooden table.
4. **Release the Bowl:** Finally, the robotic arm must release the bowl onto the plate.

**Step Intervals and Justifications:**

1. **Approach the Bowl (Steps 0-93):**
   - **Steps 0-65:** The robotic arm initially remains stationary, possibly due to initialization or waiting for the start signal.
   - **Steps 66-93:** The robotic arm moves left and then left down to approach the black bowl on the wooden cabinet. This movement is necessary to align the arm with the bowl's position.

2. **Grasp the Bowl (Steps 94-108):**
   - **Steps 94-108:** The robotic arm moves down to reach the bowl and grasp it. This downward movement is essential to ensure the arm can securely grasp the bowl.

3. **Move to the Plate (Steps 109-133):**
   - **Steps 109-118:** The robotic arm remains stationary, possibly to stabilize the grip on the bowl.
   - **Steps 128-133:** The robotic arm moves up to lift the bowl and then navigates to the plate. Moving up is necessary to clear any obstacles and prepare for the horizontal movement to the plate.

4. **Release the Bowl (Steps 134-138):**
   - **Steps 134-138:** The robotic arm remains stationary, possibly to ensure the bowl is properly placed on the plate before releasing it.
