### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl located on a stove and place it on a white plate situated on a wooden table. The environment contains a stove, a wooden table, a black bowl, and a white plate. The black bowl is initially on the stove, and the white plate is on the wooden table. The goal is to move the black bowl from the stove to the white plate without dropping it or causing any damage.

#### High-Level Movements and Justification
Based on the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals and justifications:

1. **Initialization (Steps 0-15):**
   - **Interval:** 0-15
   - **Justification:** The robot starts in a neutral position and needs to prepare for the task. This involves ensuring the arm is in a safe and ready state before making any significant movements.
   - **High-Level Step:** Prepare for the task.
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to ensure it is in a stable and controlled position before starting the actual task.

2. **Approach the Stove (Steps 16-78):**
   - **Interval:** 16-78
   - **Justification:** The robot needs to move its arm towards the stove to reach the black bowl. This involves moving the arm downward to align with the height of the stove and then moving forward to reach the bowl.
   - **High-Level Step:** Move towards the black bowl on the stove.
   - **Reason:** The black bowl is located on the stove, and the robot must approach it to grasp it.

3. **Grasp the Bowl (Steps 79-106):**
   - **Interval:** 79-106
   - **Justification:** Once the robot is in position, it needs to grasp the black bowl. This involves moving the arm downward to reach the bowl and then stopping to ensure a secure grip.
   - **High-Level Step:** Grasp the black bowl.
   - **Reason:** The robot must securely grasp the bowl to prevent it from falling during the transfer.

4. **Lift the Bowl (Steps 107-135):**
   - **Interval:** 107-135
   - **Justification:** After grasping the bowl, the robot needs to lift it off the stove and prepare to move it to the white plate. This involves moving the arm upward to lift the bowl and then stopping to stabilize the movement.
   - **High-Level Step:** Lift the black bowl.
   - **Reason:** The bowl must be lifted off the stove to clear the way for moving it to the white plate.
