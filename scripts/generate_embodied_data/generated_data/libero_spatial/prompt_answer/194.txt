### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task is to **pick up the black bowl from the table center and place it on the plate**. The environment consists of a table with a black bowl near a plate and a white bowl near a red and white plate. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, and then move it to the plate.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features`, the high-level movements executed by the robotic arm are likely the following:
1. **Approach the black bowl**: Move the arm to the location of the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: Pick up the black bowl.
3. **Move to the plate**: Navigate the arm to the location of the plate.
4. **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Release the black bowl onto the plate.

#### Intervals of High-Level Movements
- **Approach the black bowl**: Steps 0-30
- **Grasp the black bowl**: Steps 31-60
- **Move to the plate**: Steps 61-90
- **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Steps 91-120
- **Final stop**: Steps 121-142

### Justification for High-Level Movements
- **Approach the black bowl**: The arm needs to move to the black bowl's location to prepare for grasping it.
- **Grasp the black bowl**: Once at the bowl, the arm needs to pick it up to start the transfer process.
- **Move to the plate**: After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to navigate to the plate to complete the task.
- **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Finally, the arm needs to release the bowl onto the plate to finish the task.
