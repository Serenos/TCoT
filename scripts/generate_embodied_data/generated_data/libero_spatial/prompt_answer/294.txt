### Task Description

The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl located next to a ramekin on a table and place it on a plate, which is also on the table. The black bowl and the ramekin are initially positioned close to each other, and the plate is at a different location on the table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the plate to complete the task.

### High-Level Movements and Plan

Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features`, the high-level movements that were executed can be broken down as follows:

1. **Move to the Black Bowl** (Steps 5-27): The robotic arm moves left to reach the black bowl.
2. **Prepare to Grasp the Black Bowl** (Steps 36-48): The robotic arm moves down to position itself to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl** (Steps 70-78): The robotic arm moves up to lift the black bowl.
4. **Move to the Plate** (Steps 80-93): The robotic arm moves forward to reach the plate.
5. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate** (Steps 99-104): The robotic arm moves down to place the black bowl on the plate.

### Plan for the Solution

The plan for the solution involves the following high-level steps:

1. **Navigate to the Black Bowl**: Move the robotic arm to the position of the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the Black Bowl**: Position the robotic arm to grasp the black bowl and ensure a secure grip.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl**: Lift the black bowl to clear the table surface.
4. **Navigate to the Plate**: Move the robotic arm to the position of the plate.
5. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate**: Position the robotic arm to place the black bowl on the plate.
