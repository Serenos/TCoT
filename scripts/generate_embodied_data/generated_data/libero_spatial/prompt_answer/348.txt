### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task involves a robotic arm that must **pick up a black bowl** located next to a **white plate** on a table and **place the bowl on the plate**. The environment consists of a table with the black bowl and the white plate placed adjacent to each other.

#### High-Level Movements and Justification
Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features`, the high-level movements executed by the robotic arm can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the Bowl**: The robotic arm needs to move downward to reach the height at which the bowl is located.
   - **Steps**: 31-43
   - **Justification**: The bowl is on the table, and the arm must lower itself to grasp the bowl.

2. **Lift the Bowl**: Once the arm has reached the bowl, it needs to lift the bowl off the table.
   - **Steps**: 63-65
   - **Justification**: After grasping the bowl, the arm must raise it to prepare for moving it to the plate.

3. **Move to the Plate**: The arm must then move horizontally to position the bowl over the plate.
   - **Note**: This movement is not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but it is implied by the task requirements.
   - **Justification**: The bowl must be moved from its initial position to the plate's location.

4. **Place the Bowl on the Plate**: Finally, the arm must lower the bowl onto the plate.
   - **Note**: This movement is also not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but it is implied by the task requirements.
   - **Justification**: The final step is to release the bowl onto the plate, completing the task.

### Plan for the Solution
- **Remaining High-Level Steps**:
  1. Approach the bowl.
  2. Lift the bowl.
  3. Move to the plate.
  4. Place the bowl on the plate.
