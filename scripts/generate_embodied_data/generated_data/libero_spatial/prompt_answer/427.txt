### Task Overview

The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl located next to a ramekin and place it on a white plate. The environment consists of a table with a white plate, a black bowl, and a ramekin. Initially, the black bowl is next to the ramekin, and the white plate is on the table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the white plate.

### High-Level Movements and Plan

Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals:

1. **Move to the black bowl**: Steps 7-26
   - **Justification**: The black bowl is located to the left of the initial position of the robotic arm. Moving left is necessary to reach the bowl.
2. **Lower the arm to grasp the black bowl**: Steps 33-47
   - **Justification**: Once the arm is positioned above the black bowl, it needs to move down to grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the black bowl**: Steps 68-72
   - **Justification**: After grasping the black bowl, the arm needs to lift it to prepare for moving it to the white plate.
4. **Move to the white plate**: Steps 83-89
   - **Justification**: The white plate is located forward from the initial position of the black bowl. Moving forward is necessary to reach the plate.
5. **Place the black bowl on the white plate**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied by the context.
