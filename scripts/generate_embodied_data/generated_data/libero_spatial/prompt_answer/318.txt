### Task Overview

#### Task Description
The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl and placing it on a white plate. The black bowl is located between the plate and a grey ramekin. Additionally, there is a dark brown wooden box with three drawers nearby, which may serve as a potential obstacle or reference point. The goal is to navigate the robotic arm to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then place it on the white plate without disturbing the ramekin or colliding with the wooden box.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the trajectory executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Approach the Black Bowl**: Move the robotic arm towards the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the Black Bowl**: Position the gripper over the black bowl and close the gripper to grasp it.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl**: Lift the black bowl off the surface.
4. **Move to the White Plate**: Navigate the robotic arm to the white plate.
5. **Place the Black Bowl**: Release the black bowl onto the white plate.

#### Intervals and Justifications
1. **Approach the Black Bowl** (Steps 9-20):
   - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to move forward to reach the black bowl, which is located between the plate and the ramekin.
2. **Grasp the Black Bowl** (Steps 21-36):
   - **Justification**: Once the robotic arm is above the black bowl, it needs to move down to position the gripper correctly and then grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl** (Steps 37-53):
   - **Justification**: After grasping the black bowl, the robotic arm needs to lift it to clear any obstacles and prepare for moving it to the white plate.
4. **Move to the White Plate** (Steps 54-103):
   - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to move up and then navigate to the white plate, avoiding any obstacles like the ramekin and the wooden box.
5. **Place the Black Bowl** (Steps 104-107):
   - **Justification**: Once the robotic arm is above the white plate, it needs to lower the black bowl and release it onto the plate.
