### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl located next to a cookie box and placing it on a nearby plate. The environment consists of the following objects and their relative positions:
- **Black Bowl**: Located next to the cookie box.
- **Cookie Box**: Positioned near the black bowl.
- **Plate**: Positioned at a distance from the black bowl and the cookie box.

### High-Level Movements and Plan

Based on the task and the trajectory executed, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Move towards the black bowl** (Steps 6-27)
   - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to reach the black bowl to pick it up. This movement is necessary to align the arm's gripper with the bowl.
   
2. **Lift the arm to avoid obstacles** (Steps 71-74)
   - **Justification**: After reaching the bowl, the arm needs to lift slightly to avoid any obstacles and prepare for the lifting of the bowl.

3. **Move towards the plate** (Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied by the context)
   - **Justification**: Once the bowl is picked up, the arm needs to move towards the plate to place the bowl on it.

4. **Place the bowl on the plate** (Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied by the context)
   - **Justification**: The final step is to place the bowl on the plate, completing the task.
