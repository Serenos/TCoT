### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl that is located next to a white plate on a table and placing it on the plate. The environment consists of a table with a white plate and a black bowl placed next to it. The goal is to execute a series of precise movements to achieve the task while avoiding any obstacles or errors.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements executed, the high-level movements that were most likely executed are:
1. **Move the arm to the position above the black bowl** (Steps 0-30)
2. **Move the arm down to grasp the black bowl** (Steps 31-40)
3. **Move the arm up with the black bowl** (Steps 41-110)

#### Justification for High-Level Movements
1. **Move the arm to the position above the black bowl** (Steps 0-30):
   - **Justification**: Before grasping the bowl, the arm needs to be positioned directly above it to ensure a precise and safe grasp.
2. **Move the arm down to grasp the black bowl** (Steps 31-40):
   - **Justification**: Once the arm is above the bowl, it needs to move down to grasp it. This movement ensures that the gripper can securely hold the bowl without knocking it over.
3. **Move the arm up with the black bowl** (Steps 41-110):
   - **Justification**: After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to lift it up to avoid any obstacles and prepare for moving it to the plate.
