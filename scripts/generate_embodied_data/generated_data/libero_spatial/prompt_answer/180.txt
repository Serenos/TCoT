### Task Description

**Task Overview:**
The task is to control a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl located in the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and place it on a plate. The environment includes a table with two bowls (one black and one silver) and a plate with a red ring around it. The cabinet has a pull handle, and the drawer is already open.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move towards the cabinet:** The robot needs to approach the cabinet to access the top drawer.
2. **Move up to the drawer level:** Once near the cabinet, the robot must move its arm to the height of the top drawer.
3. **Move left to align with the drawer:** After reaching the correct height, the robot needs to move left to align with the open drawer.
4. **Move down into the drawer:** The robot then moves its arm down into the drawer to reach the black bowl.
5. **Pick up the black bowl:** The robot picks up the black bowl from the drawer.
6. **Move up and out of the drawer:** The robot lifts the bowl out of the drawer.
7. **Move towards the plate:** The robot then moves towards the plate on the table.
8. **Place the black bowl on the plate:** Finally, the robot places the black bowl on the plate.

**Intervals of High-Level Movements:**
- **Move towards the cabinet:** Steps 7-23
- **Move up to the drawer level:** Steps 64-67
- **Move left to align with the drawer:** Steps 74-93
- **Move down into the drawer:** Steps 93-106
- **Pick up the black bowl:** (Assumed to be part of the movement down into the drawer)
- **Move up and out of the drawer:** (Assumed to be part of the movement out of the drawer)
- **Move towards the plate:** (Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but assumed to follow after the bowl is picked up)
- **Place the black bowl on the plate:** (Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but assumed to follow after moving towards the plate)
