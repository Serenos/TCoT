### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl located between a white plate and a red and white striped ramekin on a wooden table and place it on the white plate. The environment is static, meaning the positions of the objects do not change during the task execution.

#### High-Level Movements and Justification
Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features`, the high-level movements executed by the robotic arm can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the Black Bowl** (Steps 5-16): The robotic arm moves forward to reach the position where the black bowl is located.
2. **Move Down to Reach the Black Bowl** (Steps 17-25): Once the arm is positioned above the black bowl, it moves downward to grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl** (Steps 30-33): After grasping the bowl, the arm moves downward slightly to ensure a secure grip and then lifts the bowl.
4. **Move Up to Clear the Table** (Steps 50-52): The arm moves upward to clear the table and prepare for moving the bowl to the plate.
5. **Move Down to Reach the White Plate** (Steps 63-68): The arm moves downward to position the bowl above the white plate.
6. **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate** (Steps 63-68): The arm releases the bowl onto the white plate.
7. **Move Up to Clear the Plate** (Steps 63-68): The arm moves upward to clear the plate and complete the task.

### Plan for the Solution
The high-level plan for completing the task is as follows:
1. Approach the black bowl.
2. Move down to grasp the black bowl.
3. Lift the black bowl.
4. Move up to clear the table.
5. Move down to reach the white plate.
6. Place the black bowl on the white plate.
7. Move up to clear the plate.
