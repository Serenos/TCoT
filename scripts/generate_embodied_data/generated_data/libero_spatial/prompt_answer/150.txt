### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl from a wooden cabinet and place it on a white plate located on a wooden table. The environment contains the following key elements:
- **Black Bowl**: Located on the wooden cabinet.
- **Wooden Cabinet**: The starting point for the black bowl.
- **White Plate**: Located on the wooden table.
- **Wooden Table**: The destination for the black bowl.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements that were most likely executed are:
1. **Move to the Black Bowl**: The robot needs to position itself near the black bowl on the wooden cabinet.
2. **Pick Up the Black Bowl**: Once positioned, the robot needs to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Move to the White Plate**: After picking up the bowl, the robot needs to navigate to the white plate on the wooden table.
4. **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate**: Finally, the robot places the black bowl on the white plate.

#### Interval of Steps for Each High-Level Movement
1. **Move to the Black Bowl**: Steps 64-94
2. **Pick Up the Black Bowl**: Steps 95-114
3. **Move to the White Plate**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied after picking up the bowl.
4. **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate**: Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but implied after moving to the white plate.

#### Justification for Each High-Level Movement
1. **Move to the Black Bowl**: The robot needs to move to the black bowl to be able to pick it up. This involves moving left to align with the bowl's position.
2. **Pick Up the Black Bowl**: Once aligned, the robot needs to move down to grasp the bowl.
3. **Move to the White Plate**: After picking up the bowl, the robot needs to move to the white plate to place it.
4. **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate**: Once at the white plate, the robot needs to place the bowl down.
