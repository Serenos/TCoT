### Task Overview

The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl located on a cookie box and place it on a plate. Both the cookie box and the plate are situated on a table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then navigate to the plate to place the bowl down. This task requires careful planning to avoid obstacles and ensure the bowl is picked up and placed accurately.

### High-Level Movements and Justification

Based on the executed trajectory and the task, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals and justifications:

1. **Move to the Black Bowl (Steps 9-27)**
   - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to reach the black bowl, which is on the cookie box. Moving forward is necessary to approach the bowl.
   - **Interval**: Steps 9-27

2. **Lower Arm to Grasp the Black Bowl (Steps 28-34)**
   - **Justification**: Once the arm is near the bowl, it needs to lower itself to grasp the bowl. Moving down is essential to reach the bowl's position.
   - **Interval**: Steps 28-34

3. **Lift the Black Bowl (Steps 55-59)**
   - **Justification**: After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to lift it to prepare for moving it to the plate. Moving up is necessary to clear the cookie box.
   - **Interval**: Steps 55-59

4. **Move to the Plate (Steps 68-74)**
   - **Justification**: With the bowl lifted, the arm needs to navigate to the plate. Moving left is required to align with the plate's position.
   - **Interval**: Steps 68-74

5. **Lower Arm to Place the Black Bowl on the Plate (Steps 76-82)**
   - **Justification**: Once aligned with the plate, the arm needs to lower itself to place the bowl on the plate. Moving down is necessary to place the bowl accurately.
   - **Interval**: Steps 76-82

### Plan for the Solution

The high-level plan for completing the task is as follows:
- **Move to the Black Bowl**: Approach the black bowl on the cookie box.
- **Lower Arm to Grasp the Black Bowl**: Lower the arm to grasp the bowl.
- **Lift the Black Bowl**: Lift the bowl to clear the cookie box.
- **Move to the Plate**: Navigate to the plate.
- **Lower Arm to Place the Black Bowl on the Plate**: Lower the arm to place the bowl on the plate.
