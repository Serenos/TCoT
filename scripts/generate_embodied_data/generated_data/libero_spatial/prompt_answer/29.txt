### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl located on a wooden cabinet and place it on a white plate situated on a wooden table. The environment consists of the following key elements:
- **Black Bowl**: Located on the wooden cabinet.
- **Wooden Cabinet**: Contains the black bowl.
- **White Plate**: Located on the wooden table.
- **Wooden Table**: Contains the white plate.
- **Robotic Arm**: The agent that will execute the task.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Move Forward**: The robotic arm moves forward to approach the wooden cabinet.
2. **Move Up**: The robotic arm moves up to reach the height of the black bowl on the cabinet.
3. **Move Left**: The robotic arm moves left to align with the black bowl.
4. **Move Down**: The robotic arm moves down to grasp the black bowl.
5. **Move to the Plate**: The robotic arm moves to the location of the white plate on the wooden table.
6. **Place the Bowl**: The robotic arm places the black bowl on the white plate.

#### Intervals and Justifications for High-Level Movements
1. **Move Forward**: Steps 28-37
   - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to move forward to reach the wooden cabinet where the black bowl is located.
2. **Move Up**: Steps 71-72
   - **Justification**: After reaching the cabinet, the arm needs to move up to align with the height of the black bowl.
3. **Move Left**: Steps 78-101
   - **Justification**: The arm needs to move left to align with the position of the black bowl.
4. **Move Down**: Steps 103-121
   - **Justification**: The arm needs to move down to grasp the black bowl.
5. **Move to the Plate**: Steps 142-144
   - **Justification**: After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to move to the location of the white plate on the wooden table.
6. **Place the Bowl**: Step 144
   - **Justification**: The arm needs to release the black bowl onto the white plate.
