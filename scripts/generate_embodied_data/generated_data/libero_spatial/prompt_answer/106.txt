### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task is to pick up the black bowl from the cookie box and place it on the plate. The black bowl is initially located on top of the cookie box, which is placed on the table. The plate is also on the table, but at a different location. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the plate and release it.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move to the black bowl:** The robotic arm needs to move forward to reach the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the black bowl:** Once the arm is close enough, it needs to move down to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the black bowl:** After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to move up to lift it.
4. **Move to the plate:** The arm then needs to move left to reach the plate.
5. **Place the black bowl on the plate:** Finally, the arm needs to move down to place the bowl on the plate.

**Intervals and Justifications:**
- **Move to the black bowl:** Steps 4-21. The arm needs to move forward to reach the black bowl, which is located on the cookie box.
- **Grasp the black bowl:** Steps 22-33. The arm needs to move down to grasp the black bowl.
- **Lift the black bowl:** Steps 51-56. The arm needs to move up to lift the black bowl.
- **Move to the plate:** Steps 59-63. The arm needs to move left to reach the plate.
- **Place the black bowl on the plate:** Steps 66-68. The arm needs to move down to place the black bowl on the plate.
