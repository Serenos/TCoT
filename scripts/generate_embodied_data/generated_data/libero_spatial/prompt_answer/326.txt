### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl located next to a ramekin on a table and place it on a plate, also located on the table. The black bowl and the ramekin are positioned close to each other, and the plate is at a different location on the table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the plate to complete the task.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down as follows:
1. **Move to the black bowl**: The robotic arm needs to move horizontally to reach the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the black bowl**: Once the arm is above the black bowl, it needs to lower itself to grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the black bowl**: After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to lift it off the table.
4. **Move to the plate**: The arm then needs to navigate to the plate while holding the bowl.
5. **Place the black bowl on the plate**: Finally, the arm should lower itself to place the bowl on the plate.

#### Intervals and Justifications for High-Level Movements
1. **Move to the black bowl**:
   - **Interval**: Steps 6-29
   - **Justification**: The black bowl is located to the left of the initial position of the robotic arm. Therefore, the arm needs to move left multiple times to reach the bowl.

2. **Grasp the black bowl**:
   - **Interval**: Steps 42-53
   - **Justification**: Once the arm is above the black bowl, it needs to move down to grasp the bowl. This involves multiple downward movements to ensure the gripper is correctly positioned.

3. **Lift the black bowl**:
   - **Interval**: Steps 74-80
   - **Justification**: After grasping the bowl, the arm needs to lift it off the table. This involves moving up and slightly forward to clear the table surface.

4. **Move to the plate**:
   - **Interval**: Steps 81-91
   - **Justification**: With the bowl in hand, the arm needs to navigate to the plate. This involves moving forward to reach the plate's location.

5. **Place the black bowl on the plate**:
   - **Interval**: Steps 93-104
   - **Justification**: Once the arm is above the plate, it needs to move down to place the bowl on the plate. This involves multiple downward movements to ensure the bowl is placed correctly.
