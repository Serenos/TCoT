### Task Description

The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl placed on a cookie box and then place it on a plate, both of which are located on a table. The environment is structured such that the black bowl is initially on top of the cookie box, and the plate is positioned elsewhere on the same table. The goal is to move the bowl from its initial position to the target position on the plate without dropping it or causing any damage.

### High-Level Movements and Plan

Based on the task and the trajectory features, the high-level movements and plan can be described as follows:

1. **Approach the Black Bowl** (Steps 5-20): Move the robotic arm towards the black bowl on the cookie box.
2. **Pick Up the Black Bowl** (Steps 21-36): Lower the arm to grasp the black bowl and lift it up.
3. **Move to the Plate** (Steps 52-78): Move the arm horizontally and vertically to position the bowl over the plate.
4. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate** (Steps 70-78): Lower the arm to place the bowl on the plate.
5. **Return to Initial Position** (Steps 79-89): Move the arm back to its initial position or a safe resting position.
