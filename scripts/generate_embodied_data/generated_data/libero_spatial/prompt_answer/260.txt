### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl from a ramekin and placing it on a white plate. The environment consists of a table where a silver bowl is also present on a ramekin, and a white plate is positioned elsewhere on the table. The black bowl, which is the target object, is located on a ramekin, and the goal is to move it to the white plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move to the black bowl:** The robotic arm must navigate to the location of the black bowl on the ramekin.
2. **Pick up the black bowl:** Once at the black bowl, the robotic arm must grasp it.
3. **Move to the white plate:** After picking up the black bowl, the robotic arm must navigate to the location of the white plate.
4. **Place the black bowl on the white plate:** Finally, the robotic arm must release the black bowl onto the white plate.

**Intervals and Justifications:**

1. **Move to the black bowl:**
   - **Interval:** Steps 8-15
   - **Justification:** The black bowl is initially out of reach, so the robotic arm must move left to align itself with the bowl's position. This movement is necessary to ensure the arm can accurately grasp the bowl.

2. **Pick up the black bowl:**
   - **Interval:** Steps 18-31
   - **Justification:** After aligning with the black bowl, the robotic arm must move down to reach the bowl. Moving down is essential to ensure the gripper can grasp the bowl without colliding with the ramekin or other objects.

3. **Move to the white plate:**
   - **Interval:** Steps 64-75
   - **Justification:** Once the black bowl is picked up, the robotic arm must move forward to reach the white plate. Moving forward is necessary to navigate the arm to the target location where the bowl will be placed.

4. **Place the black bowl on the white plate:**
   - **Interval:** Steps 76-127
   - **Justification:** After reaching the white plate, the robotic arm must stop and prepare to release the black bowl. This involves ensuring the bowl is correctly positioned over the plate before releasing it.
