### Task Description

The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl located next to a ramekin and placing it on a nearby plate. The environment consists of the black bowl, the ramekin, and the plate, all of which are within the operational range of the robotic arm. The high-level movements required to complete this task can be broken down into several key steps:

1. **Positioning**: Move the robotic arm to the location of the black bowl.
2. **Grasping**: Pick up the black bowl.
3. **Transporting**: Move the black bowl to the location of the plate.
4. **Placing**: Place the black bowl on the plate.

Based on the trajectory features provided, the robotic arm first moved horizontally to align with the black bowl, then moved vertically to reach the bowl, and finally moved forward to grasp the bowl. After grasping the bowl, it moved back to the starting position and then moved horizontally and vertically to align with the plate, where it placed the bowl.

### High-Level Movements and Justification

1. **Positioning** (Steps 7-31):
   - **Interval**: 7-31
   - **Justification**: The robotic arm needs to move horizontally to the left to align with the black bowl. This is necessary because the bowl is located to the left of the initial position of the robotic arm.

2. **Grasping** (Steps 35-46):
   - **Interval**: 35-46
   - **Justification**: After aligning with the black bowl, the robotic arm needs to move vertically downward to reach the bowl. This is necessary to position the gripper at the correct height to grasp the bowl.

3. **Transporting** (Steps 67-74):
   - **Interval**: 67-74
   - **Justification**: Once the bowl is grasped, the robotic arm needs to move forward to transport the bowl to the location of the plate. This is necessary to bring the bowl closer to the plate for placement.

4. **Placing** (Steps 75-111):
   - **Interval**: 75-111
   - **Justification**: After transporting the bowl, the robotic arm needs to stop and then move to the correct position over the plate. This is necessary to ensure the bowl is placed accurately on the plate.
