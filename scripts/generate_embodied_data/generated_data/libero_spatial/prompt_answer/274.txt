### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task involves controlling a robotic arm to pick up a black bowl from a cookie box and place it on a plate. Both the cookie box and the plate are located on a table. The robotic arm must navigate to the black bowl, grasp it, lift it, move to the plate, and release the bowl onto the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Navigate to the black bowl:** The robotic arm must move forward to reach the black bowl on the cookie box.
2. **Lower the arm to grasp the bowl:** Once the arm is above the bowl, it must move downward to grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the bowl:** After grasping the bowl, the arm must move upward to lift the bowl off the cookie box.
4. **Move to the plate:** The arm must then move horizontally to the plate.
5. **Lower the arm to place the bowl:** The arm must move downward to place the bowl on the plate.
6. **Release the bowl:** Finally, the arm releases the bowl onto the plate.

**Intervals of High-Level Movements:**
- **Navigate to the black bowl:** Steps 3-21
- **Lower the arm to grasp the bowl:** Steps 22-32
- **Lift the bowl:** Steps 53-57
- **Move to the plate:** Steps 62-69
- **Lower the arm to place the bowl:** Steps 72-78
