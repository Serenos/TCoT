### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task involves a robotic arm that must pick up a black bowl located on a stove and place it on a white plate situated on a table. The environment contains a stove with a black bowl and a table with a white plate. The goal is to move the black bowl from the stove to the plate while avoiding any obstacles and ensuring the bowl is securely grasped and transferred.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements that were likely executed are as follows:
1. **Approach the Stove**: Move the robotic arm towards the stove to reach the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the Bowl**: Position the gripper over the bowl and grasp it.
3. **Lift the Bowl**: Raise the bowl off the stove.
4. **Move to the Plate**: Navigate the arm to the location of the white plate on the table.
5. **Place the Bowl**: Release the bowl onto the plate.
6. **Retract the Arm**: Move the arm away from the plate to a safe position.

#### Intervals of Steps for Each High-Level Movement
- **Approach the Stove**: Steps 0-14 (No actual movement, just preparation)
- **Grasp the Bowl**: Steps 15-18 (Moving down to grasp the bowl)
- **Lift the Bowl**: Steps 19-44 (No actual movement, just holding the bowl)
- **Move to the Plate**: Steps 45-144 (No actual movement, just preparation)

### Plan for the Solution
The plan to complete the task is as follows:
1. **Approach the Stove**: Move the arm to the position where the bowl is located.
2. **Grasp the Bowl**: Carefully position the gripper and grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the Bowl**: Raise the bowl to a safe height to avoid obstacles.
4. **Move to the Plate**: Navigate the arm to the plate's location.
5. **Place the Bowl**: Gently release the bowl onto the plate.
6. **Retract the Arm**: Move the arm to a safe position away from the plate.
