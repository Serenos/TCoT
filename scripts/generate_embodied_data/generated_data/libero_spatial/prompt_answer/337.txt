### Task Description

The task involves a robotic arm picking up a black bowl that is initially placed on a ramekin, which itself is on a plate, and then placing the bowl directly on the plate. The environment is structured such that the ramekin is positioned on the plate, and the black bowl is on top of the ramekin. The goal is to execute a series of movements that will allow the robotic arm to grasp the bowl, lift it off the ramekin, and place it on the plate.

### High-Level Movements and Plan

Based on the task and the executed trajectory, the high-level movements can be broken down into the following intervals:

1. **Positioning the Arm to Reach the Bowl (Steps 11-13)**
   - **Justification**: The arm needs to move left to align with the position of the bowl on the ramekin. This is necessary to ensure that the gripper is in the correct horizontal position to grasp the bowl.
   
2. **Lowering the Arm to Grasp the Bowl (Steps 23-29)**
   - **Justification**: After aligning horizontally, the arm must move downward to reach the height of the bowl. This is essential to ensure that the gripper can securely grasp the bowl without knocking it over.

3. **Moving the Arm Forward to Place the Bowl on the Plate (Steps 69-87)**
   - **Justification**: Once the bowl is grasped, the arm needs to move forward to position the bowl over the plate. This ensures that the bowl is placed accurately on the target location.

### Plan for the Solution

- **High-Level Plan**:
  1. Move the arm left to align with the bowl.
  2. Lower the arm to grasp the bowl.
  3. Move the arm forward to place the bowl on the plate.
