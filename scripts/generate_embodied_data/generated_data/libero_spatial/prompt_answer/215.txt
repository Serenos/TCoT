### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task is to pick up a black bowl from a wooden cabinet and place it on a white plate located on a wooden table. The robot must navigate its arm to the black bowl, grasp it, and then move it to the location of the white plate.

**Environment Description:**
- **Black Bowl:** Located on a wooden cabinet.
- **White Plate:** Located on a wooden table.
- **Wooden Cabinet:** Contains the black bowl.
- **Wooden Table:** Contains the white plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move to the Black Bowl:**
   - Steps 28-33: Move down to align with the height of the black bowl.
   - Steps 56-80: Move left to align with the horizontal position of the black bowl.
   - Steps 90-108: Move down to reach the black bowl and grasp it.

2. **Move to the White Plate:**
   - Steps 109-124: Move to the white plate and place the black bowl on it.

### Plan for the Solution

**Plan:**
1. **Move to the Black Bowl:**
   - Align vertically with the black bowl.
   - Align horizontally with the black bowl.
   - Reach and grasp the black bowl.
2. **Move to the White Plate:**
   - Align vertically with the white plate.
   - Align horizontally with the white plate.
   - Place the black bowl on the white plate.
