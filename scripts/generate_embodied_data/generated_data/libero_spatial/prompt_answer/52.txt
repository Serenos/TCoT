### Task Description

#### Overview of the Task
The task is to pick up a black bowl that is initially placed on a ramekin, which is itself on a plate, and then place the black bowl directly on the plate. The robotic arm must navigate through the environment, grasp the black bowl, lift it, and then move it to the desired location on the plate.

#### High-Level Movements
Based on the task and the primitive movements listed in the `trajectory_features` dictionary, the high-level movements executed by the robotic arm can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the Black Bowl**: The robotic arm moves downward and slightly backward to reach the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the Black Bowl**: The robotic arm stops to ensure it has a firm grip on the bowl.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl**: The robotic arm moves upward to lift the bowl off the ramekin.
4. **Move to the Plate**: The robotic arm moves forward to position the bowl over the plate.
5. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate**: The robotic arm stops to ensure the bowl is placed correctly on the plate.

#### Intervals and Justifications for High-Level Movements
1. **Approach the Black Bowl**: Steps 17-30
   - **Justification**: The black bowl is initially on the ramekin, and the robotic arm needs to move downward and slightly backward to reach it. This ensures the arm is in the correct position to grasp the bowl without colliding with the ramekin or the plate.
2. **Grasp the Black Bowl**: Steps 31-50
   - **Justification**: After reaching the bowl, the robotic arm needs to stop to ensure it has a firm grip on the bowl. This prevents the bowl from slipping during the lifting process.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl**: Steps 51-54
   - **Justification**: Once the bowl is grasped, the robotic arm needs to move upward to lift it off the ramekin. This ensures the bowl is clear of the ramekin and ready to be moved to the plate.
4. **Move to the Plate**: Steps 60-73
   - **Justification**: After lifting the bowl, the robotic arm needs to move forward to position the bowl over the plate. This ensures the bowl is aligned correctly with the plate before placing it.
5. **Place the Black Bowl on the Plate**: Steps 74-112
   - **Justification**: Once the bowl is positioned over the plate, the robotic arm needs to stop to ensure the bowl is placed correctly on the plate. This ensures the task is completed successfully.
