### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl from the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and place it on a white plate located on the counter. The environment contains a wooden cabinet with a top drawer, a counter, and a table. The black bowl is inside the top drawer, a silver bowl is also in the top drawer, a white plate is on the counter, and a red and white striped plate is on the table. The robotic arm must navigate to the cabinet, open the drawer, pick up the black bowl, and then navigate to the counter to place the bowl on the white plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Navigate to the Wooden Cabinet:** The robotic arm needs to move towards the wooden cabinet where the black bowl is located.
2. **Open the Top Drawer:** Once at the cabinet, the arm needs to open the top drawer to access the black bowl.
3. **Pick Up the Black Bowl:** After opening the drawer, the arm needs to identify and pick up the black bowl.
4. **Navigate to the Counter:** With the black bowl in hand, the arm needs to move towards the counter where the white plate is located.
5. **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate:** Finally, the arm needs to place the black bowl on the white plate.

**Step Intervals for High-Level Movements:**
- **Navigate to the Wooden Cabinet:** Steps 6-17
- **Open the Top Drawer:** Steps 80-86
- **Pick Up the Black Bowl:** Steps 95-126 (Assuming the picking up process involves moving left to reach the bowl and moving down to grasp it)
- **Navigate to the Counter:** Steps 128-155 (No specific movements are shown, but this could be inferred as the robot holding the bowl and moving to the counter)
- **Place the Black Bowl on the White Plate:** Not explicitly shown in the trajectory, but assumed to be the final action after reaching the counter.
