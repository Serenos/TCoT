### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The robotic arm is tasked with picking up a black bowl from the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and placing it on a white plate. The environment contains several objects: a wooden cabinet with drawers, a black bowl inside the top drawer, a silver mixing bowl, a red and white striped plate, and a white plate on the table. The goal is to navigate the robotic arm to the top drawer, open it, retrieve the black bowl, and then navigate to the white plate to place the bowl on it.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move to the Wooden Cabinet:** The robotic arm needs to move forward to reach the wooden cabinet where the black bowl is located.
2. **Move Up to Reach the Top Drawer:** Once at the cabinet, the arm must move up to align with the top drawer.
3. **Move Left to Align with the Drawer Handle:** After reaching the height of the top drawer, the arm must move left to align with the handle.
4. **Move Down to Open the Drawer:** The arm must then move down to grasp and open the drawer.
5. **Move Down Further to Pick Up the Bowl:** After opening the drawer, the arm must move further down to pick up the black bowl.
6. **Move to the White Plate:** The arm must then navigate to the white plate on the table.
7. **Place the Bowl on the Plate:** Finally, the arm must lower the bowl and place it on the white plate.

**Step Intervals for High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move to the Wooden Cabinet:** Steps 7-23
2. **Move Up to Reach the Top Drawer:** Steps 66-76
3. **Move Left to Align with the Drawer Handle:** Steps 81-94
4. **Move Down to Open the Drawer:** Steps 101-110
5. **Move Down Further to Pick Up the Bowl:** Steps 112-118
6. **Move to the White Plate:** (Not explicitly shown in the trajectory)
7. **Place the Bowl on the Plate:** (Not explicitly shown in the trajectory)
