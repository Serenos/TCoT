### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task is to pick up a black bowl from a ramekin and place it on a plate. The black bowl is initially positioned on the ramekin, which is itself placed on the plate. The robotic arm must navigate to the bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then place it on the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Approach the bowl:** The robotic arm needs to move downward to reach the bowl's position.
2. **Grasp the bowl:** Once the arm is in position, it needs to execute the grasping action.
3. **Lift the bowl:** After grasping, the arm must move upward to lift the bowl off the ramekin.
4. **Move to the plate:** The arm then needs to move forward to the plate's position.
5. **Place the bowl:** Finally, the arm should release the bowl onto the plate.

**Intervals and Justifications:**
1. **Approach the bowl (Steps 17-20):**
   - **Justification:** The arm needs to move downward to reach the bowl's position on the ramekin.
2. **Grasp the bowl (Steps 56-61):**
   - **Justification:** The arm needs to move downward and backward to align with the bowl and grasp it.
3. **Lift the bowl (Steps 80-84):**
   - **Justification:** The arm needs to move upward to lift the bowl off the ramekin.
4. **Move to the plate (Steps 85-97):**
   - **Justification:** The arm needs to move forward to reach the plate's position.
5. **Place the bowl (Step 99 onwards):**
   - **Justification:** The arm needs to stop and release the bowl onto the plate.
