### Task Description

**Task Overview:**
The task is to pick up a black bowl from the center of the table and place it on a white paper plate. The black bowl is initially located at the center of the table, and the white paper plate is also on the table, though its exact position relative to the bowl is not specified. The robot must navigate to the bowl, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the plate.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Move to the bowl:** The robot needs to position itself directly above the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the bowl:** Once positioned, the robot must lower its arm to grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the bowl:** After grasping, the robot must lift the bowl to clear the table surface.
4. **Move to the plate:** The robot must then navigate to the position of the white paper plate.
5. **Place the bowl:** Finally, the robot must lower the bowl and release it onto the plate.

**Interval of Steps for Each High-Level Movement:**
1. **Move to the bowl:** Steps 0-16 (all stops)
2. **Grasp the bowl:** Steps 17-27 (moving down)
3. **Lift the bowl:** Steps 28-74 (all stops)
4. **Move to the plate:** Steps 75-76 (moving down, then stops)
5. **Place the bowl:** Steps 77-130 (all stops)

**Justification for Each High-Level Movement:**
1. **Move to the bowl:** The robot needs to position itself directly above the black bowl to ensure it can grasp it accurately.
2. **Grasp the bowl:** Lowering the arm is necessary to reach the bowl and grasp it securely.
3. **Lift the bowl:** Lifting the bowl is required to clear the table surface and prepare for moving it to the plate.
4. **Move to the plate:** Navigating to the plate ensures the robot can place the bowl in the correct location.
5. **Place the bowl:** Lowering the bowl and releasing it onto the plate completes the task.
