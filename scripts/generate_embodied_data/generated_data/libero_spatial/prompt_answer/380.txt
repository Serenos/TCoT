### Task Overview

**Task Description:**
The task involves a robotic arm that needs to pick up a black bowl from the center of a table and place it on a plate. The black bowl is located near a plate, and there is also a white bowl near a stack of plates. The goal is to move the black bowl to the designated plate while avoiding any obstacles or interfering with the white bowl and the stack of plates.

**High-Level Movements:**
1. **Approach the Black Bowl:** Move the robotic arm towards the black bowl located at the center of the table.
2. **Grasp the Black Bowl:** Lower the robotic arm to grasp the black bowl.
3. **Lift the Black Bowl:** Raise the robotic arm to lift the black bowl off the table.
4. **Move to the Plate:** Move the robotic arm horizontally towards the plate.
5. **Place the Black Bowl:** Lower the robotic arm to place the black bowl on the plate.
6. **Retract the Arm:** Move the robotic arm away from the plate to complete the task.

**Step Intervals and Justifications:**

1. **Approach the Black Bowl:**
   - Steps: 9-14
   - Justification: The robotic arm needs to move forward to reach the black bowl, which is located at the center of the table.

2. **Grasp the Black Bowl:**
   - Steps: 18-30
   - Justification: The robotic arm must move downward to reach the black bowl and grasp it securely.

3. **Lift the Black Bowl:**
   - Steps: 50-54
   - Justification: After grasping the black bowl, the robotic arm needs to lift it off the table to prepare for moving it to the plate.

4. **Move to the Plate:**
   - Steps: 73-76
   - Justification: The robotic arm needs to move downward again to position itself over the plate where the black bowl will be placed.

5. **Place the Black Bowl:**
   - Steps: 73-76
   - Justification: The robotic arm must lower the black bowl onto the plate and release it.

6. **Retract the Arm:**
   - Steps: 55-67
   - Justification: After placing the black bowl on the plate, the robotic arm needs to move back to its initial position or a safe position.
